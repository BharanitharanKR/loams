# Local CI

Loams CI for pull requests and pushes to `dev` runs on two laptops on the owner's tailnet. GitHub-hosted
runners are kept for releases (owner, 2026-10-24). Everything on the laptops is set up by one
idempotent command, [`deploy/ci-hosts/setup-host.sh`](../../deploy/ci-hosts/setup-host.sh).

## What runs where

| Host | Role | Services |
|---|---|---|
| Laptop A (`loams-ci-a`, CachyOS, 14 cores, 15 GB) | primary | NativeLink scheduler + CAS + action cache + 1 worker; sccache store; runners for `ostrium-labs/loams` and `ostrium-labs/iggy` |
| Laptop B (Linux Mint, 16 GB, 200 GB) | worker | NativeLink worker (joins A over the tailnet); a runner for `ostrium-labs/loams` |

| Service | Unit | Listens on | Auth | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NativeLink clients (CAS, AC, ByteStream, Capabilities, Execution; instance `main`) | `loams-nativelink.service` | `127.0.0.1:50051`, `<tailnet-ip>:50051` | tailnet: mutual TLS | A: 30 GiB (CAS 23 + worker 6 + AC 1); B: 80 GiB worker store |
| NativeLink workers + health | same | `127.0.0.1:50061`, `<tailnet-ip>:50061` | tailnet: mutual TLS | |
| sccache store (dufs, WebDAV) | `loams-sccache-store.service` + `loams-sccache-evict.timer` | `127.0.0.1:50081`, `<tailnet-ip>:50081` | password | 10 GiB, LRU every 10 min |
| GitHub runners | `~ci/.config/systemd/user/loams-runner-<repo>.service` | outbound only | GitHub registration | 10 GiB RAM each on A, 12 GiB on B |

Nothing listens on `0.0.0.0` or the LAN; ufw opens the three ports on `tailscale0` only. The tailnet
also has other people's devices, so the tailnet listeners need a credential too.

## Security model

- Everything runs as the unprivileged `ci` user: locked password, no sudo, home mode 700. It cannot
  read the owner's home (mode 700), where the credential files live.
- Jobs run in a rootless podman container (Ubuntu 24.04). `sudo apt-get` inside a job is root in
  the container only, which is the `ci` user on the host.
- Fork pull requests from outside contributors need a maintainer's approval before any workflow runs
  (repository setting "Require approval for all external contributors", on `loams` and `iggy`).
- Even approved, a pull request from a fork whose author is not an organisation member or owner
  never runs on the laptops: the `runs-on:` expression sends it to GitHub-hosted runners, with the
  same check names. Only pushes to `dev` and pull requests into `dev` from branches in the
  repository (or from members' forks) run locally. A job-level `if:` that skipped those jobs instead
  would report the required checks as passed, so the guard is in `runs-on:`.
- Secrets: the CA key (`~/.config/loams-ci/ca/ca.key`), the client certificates and the sccache
  password are generated on the host, kept in files of mode 600 (640 for group `ci`), and never
  printed or committed.

## Measured effect of sccache (2026-10-24)

`cargo build -p loams-gateway --locked` from an empty `target/`, in the runner container on
laptop A (6 jobs): **63 s cold** (124 compilations, all misses, written to the store) and **16 s
warm** (124 of 124 cacheable compilations hit; the rest is build scripts, linking and the 21
non-cacheable calls). From laptop B's setup over the tailnet, a small crate went from 36 s to 3 s.
sccache keys include absolute paths, so both laptops use the same paths (`/mnt/Projects/ci/...`).

## Switching back to GitHub-hosted runners

The repository variable `CI_RUNNER` picks the runners:

| `CI_RUNNER` | Pull requests into `dev`, pushes to `dev` |
|---|---|
| `local` | the laptops (`[self-hosted, loams-local]`) |
| `github` or unset | GitHub-hosted |

```sh
gh variable set CI_RUNNER --repo ostrium-labs/loams --body github   # fall back
gh variable set CI_RUNNER --repo ostrium-labs/loams --body local    # back to the laptops
```

**Laptop asleep → CI waits.** A job routed to `loams-local` waits in the queue until a runner with
that label is online (GitHub cancels it after 24 hours). If both laptops are asleep or offline, flip
`CI_RUNNER=github`; re-run the waiting workflows (`gh run rerun <id>`) so they pick up the new value.

Pull requests into `main`, pushes to `main`, tags, dispatches, the nightly and every release,
image, signing and SDK publishing workflow always run on GitHub-hosted runners.

## Day to day

```sh
deploy/ci-hosts/status.sh             # or /opt/loams-ci/bin/loams-ci-status; exit 1 on a problem
deploy/ci-hosts/status.sh --github    # also: runners online on GitHub, the CI_RUNNER value
deploy/ci-hosts/status.sh --json
journalctl -u loams-nativelink -f
journalctl -u loams-ci-monitor        # the health report every 15 minutes
sudo systemctl --user -M ci@ status 'loams-runner-*'
sudo systemctl --user -M ci@ restart loams-runner-loams
```

`status.sh` needs no sudo: it checks the units, the health endpoints, the listening addresses,
free disk, the runner processes and the cache sizes against their caps. Cache sizes come from
`/run/loams-ci/sizes`, which `loams-ci-monitor.timer` (root) refreshes every 15 minutes; the same
timer logs the report and fails its unit on a problem, so `systemctl --failed` shows it.

| Cache | Where | Cap | Eviction |
|---|---|---|---|
| NativeLink CAS + AC + worker store | `/mnt/Projects/ci/nativelink` | 30 GiB (A), 80 GiB (B) | NativeLink's LRU, on insert |
| sccache | `/mnt/Projects/ci/sccache` (A only) | 10 GiB | `loams-sccache-evict.timer`, every 10 min, down to 90% |
| runner work dirs | `/mnt/Projects/ci/runners/*/work` | per job | `job-completed` hook removes the checkout and temp files |
| cargo registry, rustup, tool cache | `/mnt/Projects/ci/cache` | none (a few GiB) | none |
| runner image | `/mnt/Projects/ci/containers` | ~1.5 GiB | rebuilt only when `deploy/ci-hosts` changes |

Disk floor: a job refuses to start (with an error naming the host) when its filesystem has less
than 20 GiB free on A, 30 GiB on B. On A that disk is shared with the owner's builds; the floor
keeps CI from filling it. When jobs fail with "Local CI host disk low", free disk or flip
`CI_RUNNER=github`.

## Changing workflows

Every Linux job of the PR/dev workflows carries the routing expression in `runs-on:`. After adding
a job or rebasing a workflow:

```sh
python3 deploy/ci-hosts/route-workflows.py          # rewrites runs-on, guards rust-cache
python3 deploy/ci-hosts/route-workflows.py --check  # exit 1 if a job is not routed
```

On the laptops, `Swatinem/rust-cache` and the "Free disk space" steps are skipped: sccache
(`RUSTC_WRAPPER`, set by the runner) replaces rust-cache, and the disk step would delete the
runners' shared tool cache. Jobs on the laptops can use NativeLink at `grpc://127.0.0.1:50051`
(instance `main`), for example for Buck2 ([Buck2 guide](buck2.md)); on GitHub-hosted runners
there is none, so remote caching must stay optional there.

## The job environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Userland | Ubuntu 24.04 container (`deploy/ci-hosts/runner/Containerfile`): build-essential, clang/lld, protoc, Python, git, gh, docker CLI with buildx and compose |
| User | root in the container (`sudo` works) = the `ci` user on the host |
| `docker` | the `ci` user's rootless podman (service containers, `docker run`, compose) |
| Rust | `CARGO_HOME`/`RUSTUP_HOME` shared and persistent; the toolchain follows `rust-toolchain.toml`; `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache`, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` 6 (A) / 10 (B) |
| Limits | memory 10 GiB (A) / 12 GiB (B) per runner; `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` unlimited and io_uring allowed (Iggy's real-server tests) |
| Network | the host's (loopback services published by service containers are on `localhost`) |
| `LOAMS_CI_HOST` | `loams-ci-a` or `loams-ci-b` |

## Setting up a host

Laptop A (primary), from a checkout, as the owner:

```sh
sudo deploy/ci-hosts/setup-host.sh --gh-token-file ~/gh.txt
```

Laptop B (worker), from laptop A, once B is reachable over SSH:

```sh
deploy/ci-hosts/provision-remote.sh USER@HOST --tailscale-authkey-file ~/tailscale.txt
```

Both are idempotent: run them again after pulling changes to `deploy/ci-hosts`, or to repair a
host. Re-running restarts only what changed (a runner restart cancels its running job). See
`sudo deploy/ci-hosts/setup-host.sh --help` for the options (caps, memory, jobs, components).

Removing a host: `sudo systemctl disable --now loams-nativelink loams-sccache-store
loams-sccache-evict.timer loams-ci-monitor.timer`, `sudo systemctl --user -M ci@ disable --now
'loams-runner-*'`, then remove the runners on GitHub (Settings, Actions, Runners).
