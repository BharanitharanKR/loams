> **Status: Stub** (2026-10-19). Track ME, design [§63](../design/63-loams-meter.md) (D1120–D1138, Q960–Q969), **approved by the owner with all defaults on 2026-10-19**. Owner direction, 2026-10-19: metering and enforcement are different; enforcement is first-class; build a small Rust core, keep the event format compatible with OpenMeter and CloudEvents, and make OpenMeter, Lago and Stripe optional exporters. The 2026-10-19 open-source decision (D1119) moves metering into this repository. The plan code is ME because MT2 is the Knative plan. Each task gets its full steps when its milestone starts.

**Goal:**
- every billable resource has an admission point that can refuse work when an entitlement is exhausted, without a network call on a lease hit;
- usage is counted exactly once and billed only from House windows;
- a tenant with no payment method is hard-stopped at its limit; overage needs a card, an opt-in and a spend cap;
- Stripe, OpenMeter and Lago receive usage when configured, and nothing depends on them.

**Architecture** (§63 §5): `loams-meter-agent` (the node agent imported from `loams-platform`, §63 §21), `loams-meter-core` (types, balance engine, lease allocator; sans-I/O), `loams-meter-gate` (the gate, `MeterSink`, observer adapters, `NoGate`), the `meter` role of `loams` (feature `meter`), House tables in the system namespace's `_meter` database, exporters behind features, and the console plugin `web/plugins/billing`.

## Global Constraints

- **Worktrees and branches:** `~/Documents/Ostriumlabs/loams-wt/me1-<task>`, one branch and one PR per task into `dev` (CodeRabbit reviews; merge on a green `CI required`). `git commit -s`. Never `git stash`, force-push or rebase shared branches.
- **Builds:** the shared target directory, one cargo build at a time, touched crates only (`cargo check -p <crate>`, `cargo nextest run -p <crate>`). Never build in `/tmp`. `fabric/` is its own workspace (D343): `loams-meter-core` and `loams-meter-gate` must build there by path with no Arrow dependency.
- **The dependency runs one way** (D202, D551 as a build rule): products depend only on `loams-meter-gate`'s traits; with `NoGate` a product behaves exactly as before. A product never calls the House or the meter's APIs on its request path.
- **Billing reads only the House** (`_meter.windows`, `_meter.period_totals`). Counters are never exported or shown as billed amounts.
- **Money** is integer micros plus an ISO 4217 code (D374); amounts are fixed-point decimals, never floats.
- **Agent principals can never hold `meter_admin` or `billing_admin`**, and only the billing exporter's service identity may call `SetPaymentState`.
- **No card data** passes through Loams; payment methods are the provider's hosted pages.
- **Nothing is cloned** without the owner's approval. `loams-platform` was cloned with approval on 2026-10-19 and is imported under `platform/` on `import-platform`; ME1 starts after that import and the no-open-core change (D1119) are on `dev`.

## Review Focus

1. **An event is counted twice or lost silently.** Tests: `duplicate_event_counted_once_in_windows`, `reconcile_splits_at_pipe_offset`, `pipe_restart_no_double_count`, `dropped_events_are_counted_metric`.
2. **A hard-limit subject overshoots more than §63 §11.4 allows.** Tests: `hard_limit_overshoot_bounded_10_nodes`, `owner_failover_learning_mode`, `exact_mode_near_zero`.
3. **A free tenant is served when the meter is down.** Test: `free_fails_closed_when_owner_unreachable`. A paid tenant fails open only within its cap: `paid_fail_open_bounded_by_cap`.
4. **A tenant or agent forges usage or grants.** Tests: `reserved_types_refused_from_tenant_credentials`, `subject_overwritten_from_credential`, `agent_cannot_write_grants`.
5. **The gate adds latency.** Bench: `gate_check_p99_under_5us` (64 threads).
6. **An exporter double-bills on retry.** Tests: `stripe_identifier_stable_across_retries`, `reclosed_window_sends_adjustment`.

---

## ME1a — Events and emitters

- **Task 0: Reconcile.** Check §63 against `dev` (D1119 merged; HS1 Task 16's pipe column names; D365's emitter built or not; GW1's observer). Record rulings.
- **Task 0b: Move the node agent.** `platform/crates/loams-meter` → `crates/loams-meter-agent` in the root workspace (reqwest 0.13, base64 0.23), crate and binary renamed; remove the emptied `platform/` workspace and its CI job. Behaviour unchanged; its tests move with it.
- **Task 1: `loams-meter-core` types and event validation.** `Event`, `Meter`, `Feature`, `Entitlement`, `Grant`, `Balance`, `Money`; the Loams usage profile on top of `loams-cloudevents` (`subject` required, JSON data, reserved types, `loamslease`). Tests: `usage_event_requires_subject`, `openmeter_schema_accepts_usage_event`, `reserved_type_prefix_detected`.
- **Task 2: `MeterSink`**: best-effort mode (D365's batched plain produce if not built yet: bounded queue, 50 ms or 1 MiB flush, drop-oldest with `loams_events_dropped_total`) and spooled mode (the agent's `Spool`, baselines advance only after the append). Tests: `sink_never_blocks`, `sink_drops_oldest_when_full`, `retry_keeps_ids`, `spooled_full_keeps_usage_in_counters`.
- **Task 2b: The agent's events and sink** move to §63 §6: types `io.loams.dev.usage.node.{cpu,memory,network}.v1`, `subject` and `tenantid`, D270's binary-mode record layout, key = `subject` with the stream's default partitioner. Tests: `agent_event_passes_usage_profile`, `agent_records_rebuild_as_cloudevents`, `agent_partition_matches_counter_owner`.
- **Task 3: Observer adapters** for `UsageObserver` (House), `ConnectionObserver` (gateway), `ComputeLifecycleObserver` plus a 60 s ticker (pg-control); deterministic ids per §63 §6.1. Tests: `house_query_event_id_is_stable`, `compute_tick_ids_dedupe_after_restart`.
- **Task 4: the `_system/_meter` stream** created by the `migrate` service (§54) in `_system`, 32 partitions, keyed by `subject`; JSON Schemas in `docs/api/meter/`. Test: `meter_stream_created_once`.

## ME1b — Storage and windows

- **Task 5: House tables and pipe** (`_meter.events` `ReplacingMergeTree`, the `LoamsStream` source and MV). Test: `duplicate_event_counted_once_in_windows`.
- **Task 6: Close job** (minute windows, roll-ups, recompute for non-additive aggregations, late re-close, versioned rows). Tests: `close_job_idempotent`, `late_event_recloses_window`, `unique_count_not_rolled_up`.
- **Task 7: Period totals and period close** at end + 2 h, with each customer's anchor. Test: `period_closes_after_grace`.
- **Task 8: `QueryMeter` and the OpenMeter query path** (`/api/v1/meters/{slug}/query`). Test: `query_marks_provisional_open_window`.

## ME1c — Entitlements, counters, reconciliation

- **Task 9: Balance engine** (burn-down order, rollover, resets, prepaid stops at zero), property-tested against brute-force replay and OpenMeter's documented examples.
- **Task 10: `CustomerService`, `EntitlementService`, `PlanService`** with OpenFGA relations `meter_admin`, `billing_admin`, `billing_viewer`; audit events. Test: `agent_cannot_write_grants`.
- **Task 11: Plans as YAML** applied through `PlanService` from the GitOps reconciler (§63 §22). Test: `meter_semantics_immutable_once_used`.
- **Task 12: Counter owners** on `_system/_meter` partition leases; recent-keys dedup; offset buckets. Test: `owner_rebuild_from_house_and_tail`.
- **Task 13: Reconciliation** every 5 minutes and at period close. Tests: `reconcile_splits_at_pipe_offset`, `drift_alert_above_one_percent`.
- **Task 14: Threshold and lifecycle events and the notifier** (webhooks signed, email, console). Test: `threshold_event_reemission_is_duplicate`.
- **Task 15: OpenMeter conformance test** against a pinned `api/openapi.yaml`.

## ME1d — Enforcement and policy

- **Task 16: Lease allocator** (sans-I/O; chunk formula, exact mode, learning mode) with `loams-detsim` runs of node kills and partitions.
- **Task 17: `LeaseService`** (internal Connect, service identities only, fenced owner epochs). Test: `stale_epoch_grant_ignored`.
- **Task 18: `Gate`** (`check`, `reserve`, `settle`; sharded atomics; background refresh). Bench: `gate_check_p99_under_5us`.
- **Task 19: Policy table and payment states** (§63 §13). Tests: `free_fails_closed_when_owner_unreachable`, `paid_fail_open_bounded_by_cap`, `overage_requires_card_and_cap`.
- **Task 20: House admission** calls the gate after the protective quotas; error mapping. Test: `house_entitlement_refusal_names_feature`.
- **Task 21: Gateway `pg` module and pg-control wake** (SQLSTATE `53400`; suspend at next idle or after 15 minutes). Test: `hard_stop_suspends_compute_after_grace`.
- **Task 22: Jobs, functions, streams, Git, sandbox** call sites.
- **Task 23: Gateway `http`, `llm`, `mcp` call sites** as each module lands (402 with reasons; LLM reserve and settle). Test: `llm_reserve_settles_actual_tokens`.

## ME1e — Exporters, console, migration

- **Task 24: Stripe exporter** (closed hour windows, `identifier`, adjustments; payment-state webhooks and daily poll). Tests: `stripe_identifier_stable_across_retries`, `reclosed_window_sends_adjustment`.
- **Task 25: OpenMeter exporter** (raw events, `loamslease` stripped).
- **Task 26: Lago exporter** (HTTP only) and the CloudEvents webhook exporter.
- **Task 27: `web/plugins/billing`**: Usage, Entitlements, Spend controls, Payment, Alerts; the 80%/100% banner. Uses `@loams/ui` and the CF1 shell.
- **Task 28: Operator pages**: Meters, Plans, Customers, Meter health.
- **Task 29: The T1 source**: the wasmtime host-report socket and reporter from platform doc 06 (PD61–PD64: `SO_PEERCRED`, per-boot epoch and HMAC, `Gap` records), reconciled per window against the cgroup total. Test: `host_report_split_never_exceeds_cgroup_total`.
- **Task 30: Kubernetes resolver and final reads** for the agent (platform MB2: pod watch, inotify on `cgroup.events`), the DaemonSet chart; translate `dev.loams.meter.v1` events for one release. Test: `churn_1000_pods_within_1_percent`.
- **Task 31: Retire the no-metering naming rules** in JB1, CP1 Task 27 and §52, and record D1134's amendments in those documents.

## ME1f — User meters and provisioning

- **Task 32: User meters** scoped to a namespace (§63 §9.6).
- **Task 33: OpenTofu provider** (`loams_meter`, `loams_feature`, `loams_plan`, `loams_customer_plan`).
- **Task 34: Docs, runbooks and the exit report.**
