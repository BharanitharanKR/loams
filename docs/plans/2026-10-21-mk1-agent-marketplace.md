> **Status: Approved stub** (owner, 2026-10-21, all defaults). Track MK, design [§73](../design/73-agent-marketplace.md) (D1445–D1479, Q1122–Q1144), with [§72](../design/72-software-factory-loop.md) for the factory agents that are its first listings. This plan specifies **MK0** (Mastra first, first-party only) task by task. MK1 (any framework, third-party), MK2 (more targets and kinds) and MK3 (paid listings, only if the owner decides) are listed at milestone level.

**Goal (MK0):** a Loams Desktop user opens the Marketplace page, finds a first-party Mastra agent, an ACP or built-in harness, or an MCP server, sees exactly what it will be allowed to do, installs it, and uses it in Studio; the listing came from a signed static index whose entries were checked for provenance and passed the Core level of the agent package conformance. The schema, the runtime contract and the conformance runner are framework-neutral from the first commit, even though MK0 lists only Mastra agents.

**Architecture** (§73 §3–§9):
- **`ostrium-labs/loams-marketplace`** (new public repository, created by the owner): listings, schemas, CI, the index build and signing.
- **`schemas/marketplace/listing.v1.json`** and **`proto/loams/marketplace/v1/listing.proto`** in this repository: the manifest's two forms, kept equal by a test.
- **`agents/loams-listing`** (TypeScript CLI, a member of the `agents/*` workspace that FT0 Task 1 adds): `lint`, `from-package` (turn a `loams.agent` block into `listing.json`), `index build`.
- **`crates/loams-agentd-marketplace`** (new): sources, index verification, revocations, install planning, installers for the `node` runtime, harness descriptors and MCP servers, the environment contract (§73 §3.3), and the conformance runner.
- **`proto/loams/agentd/v1/marketplace.proto`**: `MarketplaceService`.
- **`ostrium-labs/loams-mastra`**: `packages/agent-host` (`@loams/agent-host`) and `packages/acp` (`@loams/mastra-acp`, shared with FT0 Task 2).
- **`web/plugins/marketplace`** (`@loams/plugin-marketplace`, modes console and studio) and **`loams marketplace`** in the CLI.

**Tech stack:** Rust 1.97 (workspace dependencies only; `sigstore` verification through the crate the release pipeline already uses, else a ruling in Task 0); TypeScript and Node ≥ 22.13; `@mastra/*` at `loams-mastra`'s pinned set; GitHub Actions on GitHub-hosted runners for the index.

**Spec:** [§73](../design/73-agent-marketplace.md) (all of it); [§53](../design/53-studio-ade.md) §6; [§60](../design/60-places-and-harness-composition.md); [§65](../design/65-loams-operator.md) for the conformance shape; the draft [publishing guide](../marketplace/publishing.md).

## Global Constraints

- **Worktrees and branches.** `~/Documents/Ostriumlabs/loams-wt/mk0-<task>`; one PR per task into `dev`, or into `loams-mastra` / `loams-marketplace` `main` where the task says. `git commit -s`.
- **Light Rust builds.** `cargo build -p loams-agentd-marketplace`; never `--workspace` locally; never build in `/tmp`.
- **Metadata only.** The index never contains package bytes.
- **No code at install.** npm installs run with scripts off; anything that needs a script is refused.
- **Nothing before consent.** No Place, role, key, file or process is created before the person confirms the generated install plan.
- **First-party only in MK0.** The index CI refuses namespaces other than `ostrium` and `loams` until MK1.
- **No telemetry.** Neither agentd nor the index reports installs.

## Review Focus

1. **An unsigned or wrongly signed index is accepted.** Expected: refused. Tests: `index_signature_required`, `index_identity_pinned`.
2. **An artifact whose integrity or provenance does not match is installed.** Expected: refused. Tests: `integrity_mismatch_refused`, `provenance_repo_mismatch_refused`.
3. **An agent gets anything outside the environment contract.** Expected: never. Test: `agent_env_is_exactly_the_contract`.
4. **An undeclared tool runs.** Expected: refused. Tests: `undeclared_acp_tool_refused`, `undeclared_mcp_tool_hidden`.
5. **A revoked version keeps running.** Expected: stopped within one check. Test: `disable_revocation_stops_agent`.
6. **Something is created before consent.** Expected: never. Test: `plan_install_creates_nothing`.

## MK0 — Mastra first, first-party only (Tasks 0–11)

### Task 0 — Rulings

Check and record: the owner has created `ostrium-labs/loams-marketplace` (Q1124); `@loams/mastra-resonate` 0.1.0 is published with provenance; the Rust Sigstore verification library and its licence; how npm provenance is verified offline from a package's attestations; ACP's permission request as agentd's ACP harness maps it today; the GitHub and Plane MCP servers' licences, transports and `server.json` (Q1129); how agentd's `AcpAgentSpec` can be registered at run time (today it is a static table).

Files: this plan. Tests: none. Gate: rulings recorded.

### Task 1 — Listing schema v1

Files: `schemas/marketplace/listing.v1.json` (every field of §73 §3.6, with `runtime.kind` enumerating `node`, `python`, `oci`, `binary`; `surfaces` requiring `acp` or `a2a` for agents; `pricing` const `free`); `proto/loams/marketplace/v1/listing.proto`; fixtures under `schemas/marketplace/testdata/` (valid agent, harness and MCP-server listings; invalid ones for each rule).

Tests: `listing_schema_accepts_fixtures`, `listing_schema_rejects_each_invalid_fixture`, `proto_and_schema_agree`.

Commit: `marketplace: listing schema v1 (MK0 Task 1, D1455)`.

### Task 2 — `loams-listing` CLI

Files: `agents/loams-listing/` with `lint <listing.json>`, `from-package <dir>` (reads `package.json` `loams.agent`), `index build <listings-dir> --out <dir>`.

Tests: `from_package_round_trips`, `lint_reports_each_rule`, `index_build_is_deterministic`.

Commit: `marketplace: the loams-listing CLI (MK0 Task 2)`.

### Task 3 — The index repository (in `loams-marketplace`)

Files: layout of §73 §5; `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (on pull requests: lint, namespace check (first-party only), artifact resolution, integrity and provenance check, LAPC Core run from Task 8, a report comment); `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (on `main`: `index build`, Sigstore keyless signing of `index.json` and `revocations.json`, publish to GitHub Pages; a release artifact for `loams-site`).

Tests: workflow self-tests on fixture listings, `unsigned_publish_fails`.

Commit (in `loams-marketplace`): `index: validate and publish a signed static index (MK0 Task 3, D1460)`.

### Task 4 — `MarketplaceService` and sources

Files: `proto/loams/agentd/v1/marketplace.proto` (`ListSources`, `AddSource`, `RemoveSource`, `Search`, `GetListing`, `PlanInstall`, `Install`, `Uninstall`, `ListInstalled`, `CheckUpdates`, `Update`); `crates/loams-agentd-marketplace/src/{sources,index,verify,revocations}.rs`; the official source pinned to the publish workflow's identity by default.

Tests: `index_signature_required`, `index_identity_pinned`, `search_filters_by_kind_framework_level`, `revocations_checked_on_start`.

Commit: `agentd: MarketplaceService, sources and signed index verification (MK0 Task 4, D1462)`.

### Task 5 — Install planning and the environment contract

Files: `crates/loams-agentd-marketplace/src/{plan,contract}.rs`: `PlanInstall` returns the consent plan (Place preview, tools by risk, egress, dependencies, secrets, models, budgets, licence, tier, provenance, version age) and creates nothing; `contract.rs` builds the §73 §3.3 environment (token file rotation every 10 minutes for 15-minute tokens; a Postgres role per install when declared; proxied MCP config).

Tests: `plan_install_creates_nothing`, `plan_lists_every_declared_permission`, `agent_env_is_exactly_the_contract`, `token_file_rotates`.

Commit: `agentd: install plans and the agent environment contract (MK0 Task 5, D1453, D1466)`.

### Task 6 — Installers: `node` agents, harness descriptors, MCP servers

Files: `crates/loams-agentd-marketplace/src/install/{node,harness,mcp}.rs`: npm tarball fetched by integrity, lockfile install with scripts off, into `<data>/agents/<id>/<version>`; provenance verified; harness descriptors registered as `AcpAgentSpec` entries at run time (`HarnessId::Marketplace(listing_id)`); MCP servers registered for harness runs and agents with secrets in the vault; uninstall keeps user data.

Tests: `integrity_mismatch_refused`, `provenance_repo_mismatch_refused`, `install_scripts_refused`, `harness_descriptor_appears_in_list_harnesses`, `mcp_server_available_to_threads`, `uninstall_keeps_data`.

Commit: `agentd: installers for node agents, harnesses and MCP servers (MK0 Task 6, D1464, D1473)`.

### Task 7 — `@loams/agent-host` (in `loams-mastra`)

Files: `packages/agent-host/`: loads `createAgent(ctx)`; builds `ctx` from the environment contract (`PostgresStore` and `PgVector` on `LOAMS_PG_URL`, `@mastra/qdrant` on `LOAMS_QDRANT_URL`, the Resonate engine on `LOAMS_DURABLE_URL`, `MCPClient` from `LOAMS_MCP_CONFIG`); registers only declared tools; serves ACP through `@loams/mastra-acp`.

Tests: `host_loads_starter_agent`, `host_registers_only_declared_tools`, `host_reads_only_contract_env`, `host_exits_on_sigterm`.

Commit (in `loams-mastra`): `agent-host: run a packaged Mastra agent under the Loams contract (MK0 Task 7, D1456)`.

### Task 8 — LAPC Core runner

Files: `crates/loams-agentd-marketplace/src/conformance/`: `loams agent conformance <package|listing>` runs LAPC-C1 to C9 (§73 §9) in a sandboxed process (process isolation and an egress-recording proxy in MK0), with a scripted model endpoint and a fake MCP server; writes a JSON report; `--sign` signs it with the CI identity.

Tests: one passing and one failing fixture agent per requirement (`lapc_c4_undeclared_tool_fails`, `lapc_c5_egress_fails`, `lapc_c7_hang_fails`, …).

Commit: `agentd: the agent package conformance runner, Core level (MK0 Task 8, D1469)`.

### Task 9 — Console and Studio

Files: `web/plugins/marketplace/` (`modes: ["console","studio"]`): browse with filters, the listing page, the consent screen from `PlanInstall`, installed agents with updates and revocation banners; Studio's harness picker "Add a harness…".

Tests: component tests for the consent screen (every permission shown), a Playwright check in `studio-e2e`: install the fixture agent and open a thread with it.

Commit: `console: the marketplace plugin and consent screen (MK0 Task 9, D1465)`.

### Task 10 — CLI

Files: `loams marketplace search|info|install|uninstall|list|update|source` through agentd.

Tests: CLI integration tests against a fixture index.

Commit: `cli: loams marketplace (MK0 Task 10)`.

### Task 11 — First-party listings and docs

Listings in `loams-marketplace`: `ostrium/loams-bot` and the factory's agents (after FT0 Task 6), `ostrium/loams-starter`, `ostrium/support-agent` (MA1 Task 43), the built-in harness descriptors, and the MCP servers of Task 0's ruling. Docs: `docs/marketplace/README.md` (status **experimental**, first-party only); a note at the top of `docs/marketplace/publishing.md` pointing to §73; the plans README row.

Tests: every listing passes `validate.yml` and LAPC Core.

Commit: `marketplace: first-party listings and docs (MK0 Task 11)`.

## MK1 — Any framework, third-party (milestone level)

The `python` (wheels only, `uv`, hashes) and `binary` runtimes; agentd's A2A bridge from `loams-agentd-link`; the model proxy (§73 §3.4) required for third-party agents; LAPC Compatible; `ostrium-labs/loams-agent-templates` and conformance cells for Pydantic AI, LangGraph, the OpenAI Agents SDK and Google ADK (Q1133); Resonate's Python SDK cell against Loams Durable (Q1143); namespace verification (GitHub OIDC, DNS, HTTP); the scanning pipeline (§73 §10.2); verified and community tiers; revocation runbook; third-party ACP harnesses such as fx; everything third-party in SB1's `linux` sandbox; the publishing guide rewritten. Estimate: 12 engineer-weeks.

## MK2 — More targets and kinds (milestone level)

The `oci` runtime; the BYOC `agents` profile; app BYOC agents on §71's contract; `loams-registry` with a publish API and MCP-Registry v0.1 compatibility; a curated MCP Registry import; templates, workflows, console plugins, connectors and factory apps as kinds; the Jailer and the gateway's `mcp` module as enforcement points. Estimate: 9 engineer-weeks.

## MK3 — Paid listings (only if the owner decides)

Through the Meter's user meters (D1138). Not designed.

## Rulings made during execution

### Task 0 (2026-10-23)

Read on 2026-10-23 at `origin/dev` `710f47078`.

1. **The index repository exists** (Q1124). `ostrium-labs/loams-marketplace` is public; the owner created it on 2026-10-21, and it holds only `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0). Task 3 starts from an empty `main`.
2. **`@loams/mastra-resonate` is not on npm** (the registry answers 404 for the whole package; MA1 Task 21 is still pending). This is the MK0 gate of §73 §12, so Task 7's end-to-end check and the Task 11 listings that depend on it wait for the publish. Tasks 1–6 and 8–10 do not need it: their fixtures are local packages. The plan carries on in order and records the wait at each affected task.
3. **Sigstore verification in Rust: `sigstore-verify`** from `sigstore/sigstore-rust` (Apache-2.0; the modular successor of `sigstore-rs`, whose `sigstore` crate is still marked experimental). It verifies a Sigstore bundle offline against a trusted root (`sigstore-trust-root`), including DSSE envelopes, Rekor inclusion and TSA timestamps. The repository's 14-day rule for new dependencies makes **0.14.0** (published 2026-09-29) the version; 0.15.0 (2026-10-13) and 0.15.1 (2026-10-23) are too new. The release pipeline uses the `cosign` CLI (`nf1-pins.yml`, cosign v3.0.6), not a Rust crate, so there was nothing to reuse. The production trusted root is the Sigstore public-good root embedded at build time and refreshed through TUF later. Tests use their own test CA and trusted root behind the same verifier interface, so `index_signature_required` and `index_identity_pinned` run without the network.
4. **The index signature** is a Sigstore bundle written by `cosign sign-blob --bundle` with keyless signing in `publish.yml` (`index.json.sigstore.json`, `revocations.json.sigstore.json`). The official source pins the certificate identity to `https://github.com/ostrium-labs/loams-marketplace/.github/workflows/publish.yml@refs/heads/main` with issuer `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`. A source added with `--identity` pins its own pair.
5. **npm provenance, verified without trusting the registry.** `dist.attestations.url` in the version document points at `/-/npm/v1/attestations/<name>@<version>`. That returns two Sigstore bundles (media type `application/vnd.dev.sigstore.bundle+json;version=0.2`): npm's publish attestation, signed by npm's key, and the SLSA provenance (`https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`), whose DSSE payload is an in-toto statement. It has the subject `pkg:npm/<name>@<version>` with a `sha512` digest, and `predicate.buildDefinition.externalParameters.workflow` with `repository`, `path` and `ref` (checked on `sigstore@3.1.0`). agentd verifies the SLSA bundle with `sigstore-verify`. It then requires:
   - the subject digest to equal the tarball's `integrity`, which equals the listing's `artifact.integrity`;
   - `workflow.repository` to equal the listing's `source.repository`;
   - the certificate's issuer to be GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

   The index CI saves both bundles into `versions/<version>/provenance/`, so an install can verify against the index's copy when the registry is unreachable. The publish attestation is recorded but not required in MK0.
6. **ACP permission requests today** (`crates/loams-agentd-harness/src/acp/{mod,approvals}.rs`). In a supervised thread, `session/request_permission` becomes an `ApprovalAsk`:
   - the tool is the call's `kind`, else its `title`;
   - the call id is `toolCallId`;
   - the arguments are `title`, `kind`, `rawInput` and `locations`;
   - the risk comes from `approvals::tool_risk`.

   The decision maps to the agent's `allow_once` or `reject_once` option. In a full-access thread the harness auto-accepts the preferred allow option. **For marketplace agents** (§73 §7.4) the request is checked against the manifest before that mapping: a tool that is not declared is rejected with the reject option and recorded, whatever the thread's mode (`undeclared_acp_tool_refused`, Task 6). A declared tool's manifest `risk` replaces the heuristic `tool_risk`. Matching uses the declared `name` against the call's `title` first, then `kind`, because ACP has no stable tool name field.
7. **`AcpAgentSpec` is static today.** It is a private struct of `&'static str` fields and `fn` pointers, built by `grok_spec()`, `devin_spec()`, `hermes_spec()` and `antigravity_spec()`. `HarnessId` is a `Copy` kebab-case enum with `#[serde(other)] Unsupported`, used across sessions, the registry and the TypeScript bindings. Run-time registration (Task 6) therefore:
   - adds an owned `AcpLaunch` (command, args, environment, install root, models) that a marketplace harness is built from, beside the static specs;
   - adds `HarnessId::Marketplace`, a unit variant so `HarnessId` stays `Copy`, with the listing id carried next to it in the descriptor and the session record (`marketplace_listing`). This replaces the plan's `HarnessId::Marketplace(listing_id)`: a `String` payload would remove `Copy` from a type used in hundreds of places. The wire name is `marketplace`, and pickers key marketplace entries by listing id.
8. **The first MCP-server listings** (Q1129).
   - **GitHub's** `github/github-mcp-server` is MIT, written in Go, and v2.0.3 (2026-10-21) ships per-OS archives with a `checksums.txt`. Its repository's `server.json` (schema `2025-12-11`, name `io.github.github/github-mcp-server`) lists only the OCI package over stdio. The remote server is `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` over streamable HTTP. MK0 lists it as the archive runtime with SHA-256 per platform, launched as `github-mcp-server stdio`, with `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as a vault secret. The listing embeds the `server.json` unchanged plus our `dev.loams/listing` block. The OCI package waits for the `oci` runtime (MK2).
   - **Plane's** `makeplane/plane-mcp-server` is MIT and now Python (FastMCP, `plane-mcp-server` 0.3.5 on PyPI, run with `uvx`). The old npm package `@makeplane/plane-mcp-server` is deprecated and must not be listed. Because `python` is an MK1 runtime, MK0 lists Plane **only as its remote** streamable-HTTP server (`https://mcp.plane.so`, personal access token from the vault, egress `mcp.plane.so`), with no local install. The stdio package follows in MK1. Neither repository's licence or transport blocks a listing.
   - Forgejo's and Sentry's servers are not checked here and stay out of MK0.
9. **Node for the `node` runtime** (Q1122). agentd already resolves `node` for npm harness adapters (`adapter_install.rs`, `executable::find_on_paths` with the node-version-manager scan). The `node` installer reuses that resolution and refuses a Node older than the listing's `runtime.version` (default `>=22.13`). Installing a pinned Node archive when none is found is left to Task 6's ruling.
10. **The `agents/*` workspace** (FT0 Task 1) is not on `dev` yet. If it has not merged when Task 2 starts, Task 2 adds the one `agents/*` line to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` itself, so the FT1 work only has to rebase.
