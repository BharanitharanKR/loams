# LV1 — Loams Live Production Readiness Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans. Work task by task, **test first**: write the named tests, run them and watch them fail, then implement until they pass. Each task lists the interfaces it must produce and the tests that must exist and pass before it is done. Where this plan gives exact values (names, paths, reasons, metric names, defaults), use them verbatim. The code is not pre-written in this plan (M0.3 Ruling 1). Record every deviation in "Rulings made during execution" at the end of this file.
>
> **Status: Planned** (2026-10-08). **Track LV**, beside track R (design [§45](../design/45-loams-live-production.md), D680–D699, Q625–Q639). LV1 finishes R1's unbuilt Tasks 13, 14, 16 and 17 (Task 15 is moot under D260) and pulls in the production-critical parts of R2 and R3 (§45 §2.3). It has five milestones, LV1a–LV1e, which are **executed in the order LV1c, LV1a, LV1b, LV1d, LV1e** (see "Milestones and order"). Branches `lv1<m>-t<N>` (for example `lv1c-t20`), stacked per milestone, based on `dev`; PRs target `dev`.

**Goal:** Loams Live passes the production exit checklist at the end of this plan:
- it runs highly available on TiKV, served on the main Connect port behind TLS and auth, with many isolated apps per cluster;
- it deploys versioned TypeScript functions and schemas with rollback, validators and online index changes;
- it backs up every app to object storage with point-in-time restore;
- it is observable and protected by quotas;
- it ships a TypeScript reactive client, React hooks and a deploy CLI;
- it runs in `loams dev` and Loams Desktop with no TiKV;
- its correctness, performance and security gates are green.

**Architecture:**
- **One store seam.** A new crate `loams-kv` holds the transaction surface `loams-live` uses (`Store`, `Txn`, `Snap`, `Ts`, the runner, the tuple codec, error classes, fault hooks). It has two backends: **embedded** (MVCC on redb, always built) and **tikv** (feature, wrapping `loams-tikv`). `loams-live` depends on `loams-kv` only (§45 §8).
- **Functions.** A new crate `loams-live-js` runs bundles in QuickJS (`rquickjs`), either in process or in a sandboxed per-app worker subprocess (`loams live-worker`) that talks to the host over framed protobuf on stdio (§45 §3.1).
- **Deployments and schema** are catalog records. Activation is a CAS of the catalog pointer. Index and validator changes are two-phase with a lifetime wait and a leased backfill job. Every catalog change also writes a `catalog` journal entry so all nodes switch at one tick (§45 §3.3, §4, §9).
- **Exposure.** `LiveService` and the new `LiveAdminService` are registered on the main Connect router (`crates/loams/src/api/connect.rs`), behind the port's TLS, auth and CORS layers. Apps are addressed by the `loams-live-app` header and resolved through an app directory in the keyspace `loams_live_system`. Per-app engines (runner, subscriptions, tailer, runtime) start lazily (§45 §6, §7).
- **Auth.** The `loams-auth` verifier (MT1's, or the verification core LV1b builds if MT1 has not merged) resolves Loams tokens and API keys. Per-app trusted issuers resolve end-user OIDC tokens. The `Authorizer` (D66) decides per app and per table (§45 §5).
- **Operations.** Multi-node session forwarding over the cluster listener, Prometheus metrics, OTLP traces, quotas with token buckets, a per-app logical backup (snapshot plus journal export) with restore into a new app, and a load harness with stored baselines (§45 §9–§12, §15).

**Tech Stack:**
- **Rust:** 1.97.1, edition 2024, workspace lints.
- **New Rust dependencies** (Task 0 checks versions, licences and that they build together):
  - `rquickjs` 0.14 (MIT), features `futures`, `loader`, `macro`, `array-buffer` (R1 row R13);
  - `seccompiler` (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause) and `landlock` (MIT OR Apache-2.0), Linux only, for the worker sandbox;
  - `prometheus-client` (Apache-2.0), only if the engine has no metrics registry by Task 29 (Task 0 checks);
  - `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-otlp` (Apache-2.0), only if M2 has not added them (Task 0 checks).
- **Reused Rust dependencies:** `redb` 4, `tikv-client` (the fork pin), `connectrpc` 0.9, `buffa` 0.9, `axum` 0.8, `rustls` 0.23, `jsonwebtoken`, `openidconnect` 4 (with MT1), `sha2`, `hmac`, `ulid`, `proptest`, `tokio`, `tracing`.
- **TypeScript:** the workspace's toolchain (TypeScript 5.9.3, Node ≥ 22, pnpm, Biome, Vitest), `@bufbuild/protobuf` 2, `@connectrpc/connect` 2, `@connectrpc/connect-web` 2, React 19 (peer) with `@testing-library/react`, and `esbuild` (MIT) for `@loams/live-cli`. Exact pins only; every new npm dependency at least 14 days old.
- **Cluster:** `tiup playground v8.5.8` as in R1 (`scripts/tikv/playground.sh`, `--tag loams-<purpose> --port-offset 17000`), `toxiproxy` for the nemesis, and the BR binary of v8.5.8 for Task 30.

**Spec:**
- [§45](../design/45-loams-live-production.md): all of it.
- [§20](../design/20-reactive-database-on-tikv.md): §4–§9, §12–§14.
- [§44](../design/44-unified-api-and-sdks.md): §4, §7.2–§7.4, §10.3–§10.4.
- [§19](../design/19-console-identity-and-agents.md) §5.
- [§38](../design/38-knative-authentik-gitops.md) §4.
- [§10](../design/10-operations.md) §3–§5.
- [Decision log](../design/13-decision-log.md): D66, D88, D111, D116–D131, D260, D600–D611, D670, D680–D699; Q31, Q35–Q37, Q625–Q639.
- As built: [R1](2026-09-27-r1-reactive-core.md) (Tasks 1–12 and their rulings rows), [MT1](2026-10-02-mt1-authentik-identity.md) (Tasks 2, 3, 7), [AP1e](2026-10-08-ap1e-electron-desktop.md) (Tasks 20, 24), [API1](2026-10-02-api1-unified-connect.md).

## Global Constraints

- **Worktree.** `~/Documents/Ostriumlabs/loams-wt/lv1-<milestone>` (for example `lv1c-embedded-store`). Never commit in the main checkout. `git commit -s` (DCO).
- **Commit areas:** `kv`, `live`, `tikv`, `auth`, `api`, `sdk`, `deploy`, `ci`, `docs`.
- **The build machine.** One cargo build at a time, the shared target directory from `~/Documents/.cargo/config.toml`. Never set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, never build in `/tmp`. Build with `-p <crate>` where possible. The TiKV playground (about 3.2 GB RSS) runs only when no cargo build runs.
- **Cluster tests skip without a cluster.** As in R1: `loams_tikv::testing::cluster()` returns `None` and prints `skipped: <test> needs LOAMS_TEST_PD` when the variable is unset. **Every Live test that does not exercise a TiKV-only behaviour runs on both backends**, through `loams_kv::testing::stores()`, which yields the embedded store always and the TiKV store when `LOAMS_TEST_PD` is set. So a plain `cargo test` covers the embedded backend on every PR.
- **No forks of PD or TiKV** (D126). `tikv-client` stays the pinned fork (R1 row F1).
- **Loopback until Task 18.** Until Task 18 merges, every Live entry point keeps R1's refusal of non-loopback addresses. Task 18 lifts it only together with TLS and auth.
- **No secrets and no user data in logs.** Tokens, API keys, document values, arguments and results never reach a log line, a span attribute, a metric label or an error message. Task 27's canary test enforces this.
- **Proto changes** go to `proto/loams/live/v1/` and keep `unstable: true` until Task 40. `buf lint` passes on every change. Regenerate the TypeScript stubs with `pnpm --filter @loams/live generate`.
- **Do not edit** `apps/desktop-electron/` or `web/` (owned by AP1e). Where Live changes what the desktop does, the task records the follow-up in "Rulings made during execution" for the desktop owner.
- **Determinism in functions** (§20 §6.2) is never relaxed.

## Rulings made while writing this plan

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The seam is an enum, not a trait object.** `loams_kv::Store` is `enum { Embedded, Tikv }` with inherent async methods, and `Txn` and `Snap` the same | No `async-trait` boxing on every read; `loams-live`'s code changes only in imports | Adding a third backend touches three enums |
| 2 | **`loams-tikv` keeps its public API.** `loams-kv`'s tikv backend wraps it, and the tuple codec and `Ts` move to `loams-kv`, re-exported from `loams-tikv` for `loams-meta-tikv` | The metastore crate stays untouched | Two names for one codec until a cleanup |
| 3 | **`Ts` is a `u64` in TSO layout** (physical ms << 18 \| logical) for both backends; `tikv_client::Timestamp` appears only inside the tikv backend | Version numbers stay comparable and identical on the wire (`StateVersion.ts`, `commit_ts`) | None |
| 4 | **One redb file per data directory** at `<data_dir>/live/store.redb`, keyspaces as a `u32` id prefix inside it, the id map in a `keyspaces` table | One file lock, one fsync stream, one GC | One app's write load delays another's commits in dev; irrelevant there |
| 5 | **The worker protocol is `loams.live.worker.v1`** (internal, not in the public API catalogue), length-prefixed protobuf frames over the child's stdin and stdout; stderr carries the worker's own logs | No sockets in the sandbox at all | A new internal proto to version; it never leaves one binary |
| 6 | **The admin service is a separate proto file** `proto/loams/live/v1/admin.proto` in the same package | The facade maps it to `loams.live.admin`; authorization can be applied per service | None |
| 7 | **Backups use protobuf segments** (`loams.live.v1.BackupSegment`), zstd-compressed, not Parquet | Lossless `LiveValue` round trip, no schema per table | External tools cannot read backups directly; an export to Parquet is later work |
| 8 | **Quota buckets are per node** (§45 §12) | No coordination on the hot path | The effective limit scales with node count; documented |
| 9 | **The lifetime check uses a fresh TSO before prewrite**, not the local clock | Both backends have a timestamp oracle; clocks drift | One more TSO fetch per mutation (batched by the client, about 0.1 ms) |

## Milestones and order

| Milestone | Tasks | Scope | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | 0 | Reconcile with the code as built | First |
| **LV1c** — embedded store | 20–23 (4) | `loams-kv`, the embedded MVCC backend, parity suites, `--live-store` and the feature split | **Second**: every later test runs on embedded per PR, and the refactor is cheapest before more code is written against `loams_tikv` types |
| **LV1a** — gates, functions, deploy, schema | 1–11 (11) | The reactive and transaction checkers, `loams-live-js`, the isolated worker, the function API, deployments and rollback, validators, online index changes, catalog entries, `LiveAdminService` (deploy half), function logs | Third |
| **LV1b** — apps, exposure, auth | 12–19 (8) | The main port, the app directory and lifecycle, the verifier, authorization, end-user OIDC, session identity, TLS and CORS, error scrubbing | Fourth; Task 14 depends on `loams-auth` (see Task 0) |
| **LV1d** — HA and operations | 24–33 (10) | Multi-node sessions, the nemesis, metrics, traces and logs, quotas, backup export, restore, the BR spike, the reference deployment, the performance harness | Fifth; Tasks 27–28 may start after Task 13 |
| **LV1e** — SDKs, docs, security, release | 34–40 (7) | `@loams/live`, the fixtures, `@loams/live-react`, `@loams/live-cli`, docs, the threat model and fuzzing, the exit report and the release gate | Last; Tasks 34–36 may start after Task 17 |

41 tasks in all (0–40).

## Review Focus

1. **No missed update across catalog changes.** Deploys, rollbacks, index backfills and identity changes in the middle of a workload never produce a pushed result that differs from a fresh snapshot evaluation. Tests: Task 1 (`reactive_checker_*`), Task 9 (`concurrent_inserts_during_backfill_are_indexed`, `checker_passes_with_index_changes_mid_workload`), Task 7 (`activation_reruns_every_subscription_once`).
2. **Tenant isolation.** An environment-scoped credential never reaches another app; a cursor never crosses apps; a cached result never crosses identities. Tests: Task 15 (`authz_matrix` and its blessed table), Task 4 (`forged_cursor_rejected`, `cursor_from_other_app_rejected`), Task 17 (`results_never_shared_across_identities`).
3. **The sandbox.** `isolated` workers cannot open files, sockets or processes, and a crash is contained. Tests: Task 5 (`worker_cannot_open_files`, `worker_cannot_open_sockets`, `worker_cannot_exec`, `worker_crash_is_function_error_and_respawns`).
4. **Backend parity.** The embedded store gives TiKV's transaction semantics. Tests: Task 21 (`kv_conformance!`), Task 22 (`every_live_suite_runs_on_embedded`), Tasks 1–2 (both checkers run on both backends through `stores()`).
5. **Backup consistency.** A restore equals the source at the restore tick. Tests: Task 30 (`restore_matches_source_snapshot_at_tick`, `pitr_to_middle_tick`).
6. **No leakage.** No token, document value or raw TiKV key appears in logs, spans, metrics or errors. Tests: Task 19 (`tikv_errors_never_leak_raw_keys`), Task 27 (`canary_never_logged`).

### Task 0: Reconcile with the code as built

**Files:** read:
- `crates/loams-live/`, `crates/loams-tikv/`, `crates/loams-live-proto/`, `proto/loams/live/v1/`;
- `crates/loams/src/{main.rs,server.rs,api/connect.rs}`, `crates/loams/Cargo.toml`;
- `sdks/typescript/packages/live/`;
- `crates/loams-auth/` (if present);
- the admin listener and metrics code (if present).

Write the reconciliation into this plan's "Rulings made during execution" (`T0-1`…).

**Consumes** (each checked against `dev`; every difference is listed with its resolution):
- `loams_live::{Runner, LiveTxn, Function, FnKind, SubKey, Subscriptions, Sessions, LiveServer, LiveConfig, Limits, AppKeys}` as R1 Tasks 8–12 built them;
- `Runner::try_quiesce` (row T9-1), which Task 9 retires;
- `loams_tikv::{Tikv, Txn, Snap, TxnOptions, TxnError, CommitMode, FaultPlan, GcBarrier, tuple}`;
- `LiveAbsent` and `CATALOGUE` in `connect.rs`;
- `LiveArgs` (`--live-listen`, `--live-pd`, `--live-keyspace`, `--live-app`, `--live-tick-read-lag-ms`, `--no-live`).

**Produces:** a short findings note covering:
1. **R1 Tasks 13, 14, 16 and 17 are unbuilt.** Check that `deploy.rs` answers `UNIMPLEMENTED`, there is no `loams-live-js`, and the TypeScript package is generated-only.
2. **Whether AP1e Task 20 (`_system:tables`) has merged.** If not, Task 12 adds it with AP1e's contract.
3. **Whether `loams-auth` exists.** That means MT1 Task 2 or the M2 identity work. Record the as-built `Verifier` and `KeyStore` surface. If absent, Task 14 builds the verification core with the interfaces in Task 14.
4. **Whether the engine has a metrics registry, an admin listener, and OTLP export** (§10 §5). If not, Tasks 27–28 add the minimum.
5. **Whether the main port has TLS and an auth layer** (MT1 Task 7). If not, Task 18 adds TLS config for the main port, gated exactly as MT1 Task 7 specifies.
6. **Naming drift.** Doc comments and log lines say "Loam Live", and `--live-keyspace`'s help says `loam_live_<app>` while the prefix is `loams_live_`. Fix them in Task 23.
7. **Versions and licences** of the new dependencies (Tech Stack); a throwaway build of `rquickjs`, `seccompiler` and `landlock` together.
8. **The owner's answers to Q625, Q626, Q629, Q631 and Q639,** if given. Otherwise the §45 defaults stand.

**Tests:** none (a reading task). **Commit:** `docs: LV1 task 0 findings`.

## LV1c — The embedded store (runs second)

### Task 20: The `loams-kv` seam

**Files:**
- new: `crates/loams-kv/{Cargo.toml,src/{lib.rs,ts.rs,store.rs,txn.rs,runner.rs,faults.rs,codec.rs,gc.rs,testing.rs,tikv.rs}}`;
- changed: `crates/loams-tikv/src/{codec.rs,lib.rs}`; every `crates/loams-live/src/*.rs` that names a `loams_tikv` type; `Cargo.toml`.

**Consumes:** `loams_tikv::{Tikv, TikvConfig, Txn, Snap, TxnOptions, TxnError, Committed, CommitMode, FaultPlan, FaultPoint, GcBarrier, tuple}`.

**Produces:**

```rust
// loams-kv
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]
pub struct Ts(pub u64);                                   // Ruling 3
impl Ts { pub fn physical_ms(self) -> u64; pub fn from_parts(ms: u64, logical: u32) -> Self; }
pub enum StoreConfig { Embedded(EmbeddedConfig), #[cfg(feature = "tikv")] Tikv(loams_tikv::TikvConfig) }
pub struct EmbeddedConfig { pub path: PathBuf, pub keyspace: String, pub root: Vec<u8>, pub gc_life_time: Duration }
#[derive(Clone)] pub enum Store { Embedded(embedded::Handle), #[cfg(feature = "tikv")] Tikv(loams_tikv::Tikv) }
impl Store {
    pub async fn open(config: StoreConfig) -> Result<Self, KvError>;
    pub async fn now(&self) -> Result<Ts, KvError>;
    pub async fn snapshot(&self, at: Ts) -> Result<Snap, KvError>;
    pub async fn run<T: Send, F>(&self, opts: TxnOptions, body: F) -> Result<Committed<T>, TxnError>
        where F: for<'t> FnMut(&'t mut Txn) -> BoxFuture<'t, Result<T, TxnError>>;
    pub fn keyspace(&self) -> &str;  pub fn root(&self) -> &[u8];  pub fn key(&self, suffix: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>;
    pub fn with_faults(self, plan: Arc<dyn FaultPlan>) -> Self;
    pub async fn barrier(&self, name: &str, at: Ts, ttl: Duration) -> Result<GcBarrier, KvError>;
    pub fn backend(&self) -> Backend;                     // Embedded | Tikv
}
pub enum Txn { .. }   // get, batch_get, scan, scan_reverse, put, insert, delete, lock_keys, start_ts() -> Ts, attempt()
pub enum Snap { .. }  // ts() -> Ts, get, batch_get, scan, scan_reverse
pub use codec::tuple;                                       // moved from loams-tikv (Ruling 2)
pub mod testing { pub async fn stores(name: &str) -> Vec<Store>; }  // embedded always, tikv with LOAMS_TEST_PD
```

The embedded variant is a stub in this task: `open` returns `KvError::Unsupported("embedded backend arrives in Task 21")`, and `testing::stores()` yields only TiKV until Task 21.

**Tests:**
- `loams-kv/tests/conformance.rs::tikv_store_roundtrip`: the tikv variant's put, get and scan behave as `loams_tikv::Tikv` (skips without PD).
- `ts_parts_roundtrip`: `from_parts` and `physical_ms` invert.
- `tuple_codec_reexport_is_identical`: bytes from `loams_tikv::tuple` and `loams_kv::tuple` are equal for a proptest of values.
- **Every existing `loams-live` test passes unchanged in behaviour** on the tikv variant. This is the refactor's gate.

**Steps:**
1. Write the three new tests and run them (they fail: no crate).
2. Create `loams-kv`, move the codec and `Ts`, and wrap `loams_tikv`.
3. Port `loams-live` imports from `loams_tikv` to `loams_kv`; `Runner::open` takes `Store`.
4. Run `cargo test -p loams-kv -p loams-live`, then the TiKV job with PD.
5. Commit.

**Commit:** `kv: add the loams-kv store seam over loams-tikv`; `live: depend on loams-kv instead of loams-tikv`.

### Task 21: The embedded MVCC backend on redb

**Files:** `crates/loams-kv/src/embedded/{mod.rs,oracle.rs,mvcc.rs,commit.rs,gc.rs}`, `src/conformance.rs`, `tests/{embedded.rs,crash.rs,conformance.rs}`; and, moved from Task 23 by ruling T20-9, `crates/loams-live/src/{config.rs,service.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/{service.rs,session.rs}`, `crates/loams/src/{main.rs,server.rs}` and `crates/loams/tests/live.rs` (every builder of a `LiveConfig`).

**Consumes:** Task 20's enums; `redb` 4.

**Produces:**
- `embedded::Handle`, a store at `EmbeddedConfig.path` with Ruling 4's layout:
  - table `versions`: `keyspace_id:u32 BE ‖ root ‖ key ‖ (u64::MAX − commit_ts) BE → [0x00 ‖ value] | [0x01]` (a tombstone);
  - table `keyspaces`: `name → id`;
  - table `oracle`: `high_water`.
- **Oracle:** physical ms from the wall clock, never going back; 18 logical bits; the persisted high-water mark advanced by 1 000 allocations or 1 s; a restart starts above it.
- **Commit:** buffered writes and lock keys. Under the store's commit mutex, conflict if any written or locked key has a version with `commit_ts > start_ts`. Group commit drains the waiting commits into one redb write transaction (one fsync).
- **GC:** deletes versions older than the newest version ≤ `safe_point`, where `safe_point = min(now − gc_life_time, oldest open snapshot, barriers)`. It runs every `gc_interval` (60 s).
- `loams_kv::conformance::kv_conformance!`, a macro that expands one `#[tokio::test]` per case for a `Store` factory.
- **(T20-9, from Task 23)** `LiveConfig.store: StoreConfig` replaces `LiveConfig.tikv`; `LiveConfig::with_store(app, StoreConfig)` beside `LiveConfig::with_tikv(app, TikvConfig)` (kept, it wraps `StoreConfig::Tikv`). `LiveServer::start` opens whatever store the config names, and `crates/loams` starts its cluster GC loop only for a TiKV store (`Store::as_tikv`). The CLI flags stay as they are until Task 23.

**Tests** (`kv_conformance!` cases run on both backends):
- `snapshot_ignores_later_commits`: a write committed after a snapshot's ts is invisible to it.
- `first_committer_wins`: two transactions writing one key, started together; exactly one commits, and the other gets `TxnError::Conflict`.
- `locked_read_conflicts_with_write`: `lock_keys(k)` in T1 and a write of `k` in T2 that commits first make T1 conflict.
- `scan_bounds_and_order`: forward and reverse scans over `[lo, hi)` return keys in order, respect the limit, and skip tombstones.
- `insert_existing_key_fails`: `insert` of a key visible at start fails with the same `TxnError` class as TiKV's `AlreadyExist`.
- `roots_are_isolated`: two roots in one keyspace never see each other's keys.

Embedded-only tests:
- `ts_monotonic_across_restart`: reopen the file; the first `now()` exceeds every timestamp issued before.
- `crash_mid_commit_is_atomic` (`tests/crash.rs`): a child process commits 1 000 multi-key transactions and is `SIGKILL`ed at a random point; after reopening, every transaction is either fully visible or absent.
- `gc_respects_barrier`: a barrier at `t` keeps a snapshot at `t` readable after GC.
- `model_check_against_reference` (proptest, 256 cases): random concurrent transactions against an in-memory reference SI model give identical commit and conflict outcomes and reads.
- `group_commit_batches_fsyncs`: 100 concurrent commits take fewer than 100 redb write transactions.

**Steps:** tests first (they fail against the stub), then implement the oracle, then MVCC reads, then commit, then GC. Run `cargo test -p loams-kv`.

**Commit:** `kv: an embedded MVCC store on redb with snapshot isolation`.

### Task 22: Parity suites on both backends

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/tests/*.rs` (parameterized over `loams_kv::testing::stores()`), `crates/loams-live/src/testing/mod.rs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**Consumes:** Tasks 20–21.

**Produces:** a `live_test!(name, |store| async { … })` macro that runs one body per backend and names the case `<name>::embedded` or `<name>::tikv`. The existing suites (`docs`, `journal`, `txn`, `subs`, `session`, `service`, `value`) are moved onto it. A CI job `live-embedded` runs `cargo test -p loams-kv -p loams-live` with no PD on every PR that touches `crates/loams-kv`, `crates/loams-live*` or `proto/loams/live`.

**Tests:**
- `every_live_suite_runs_on_embedded`: a meta-test lists the `#[test]` names and asserts each has an `::embedded` variant, except an allowlist of TiKV-only tests (TSO-stream loss, region errors, PD stall), each with a comment saying why.
- The full existing suites, on embedded.

**Steps:** write the macro and the meta-test (it fails), migrate the suites, fix any parity gap by changing **the embedded backend**, never the test, unless the test asserted a TiKV-only detail (record a ruling).

**Commit:** `live: run the Live suites on the embedded and TiKV backends`.

### Task 23: `--live-store`, the feature split and dev defaults

**Files:** `crates/loams/{Cargo.toml,src/main.rs,src/server.rs}`, `crates/loams/tests/live_dev.rs`, `crates/loams-live/src/config.rs` (only the default store and the naming fixes: `LiveConfig.store` arrives in Task 21, ruling T20-9), `docs/build-from-source/` (the feature list), `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Consumes:** `LiveArgs`, `LiveRuntime`, `ServerError::Live*`.

**Prerequisites** (Task 21 review, minor items 3 and 4, to land before the embedded store becomes the default):
- **Incremental embedded GC.** A GC round works in bounded key ranges, one redb write transaction each, with a resume cursor between them. It never collects an unbounded list of doomed versions, and it never holds the write lock for a whole-table scan.
- **Scans skip older versions.** An embedded scan re-seeks past a key's older versions instead of stepping through them. A large scan runs in `spawn_blocking` (row T21-12) rather than inline on a runtime worker.
- Tests: GC of a store with more versions than one range takes several write transactions and finishes; a scan over keys with many versions reads each key's newest visible one; neither blocks a concurrent commit for a whole-table pass.

**Produces:**
- Cargo features: `live = ["dep:loams-live", "loams-kv/embedded"]`, **in `default`**; `live-tikv = ["live", "tikv", "loams-kv/tikv"]`. The `full` variant enables `live-tikv`.
- The flag `--live-store <embedded | tikv://<pd>[,<pd>]/<keyspace>>`, default `embedded`, stored under `<data_dir>/live/`. `--live-pd` and `--live-keyspace` stay one release as aliases that imply `tikv://` and print a deprecation line.
- `--no-live` unchanged.
- `LiveConfig.store` (from Task 21, T20-9) defaults to `StoreConfig::Embedded` under `<data_dir>/live/store.redb`.
- The naming fixes of Task 0 item 6.
- **Desktop follow-up** (recorded, not done here): AP1e's engine args can drop the TiKV-gated `--no-live` (D692 amends D670).

**Tests:**
- `dev_starts_live_without_pd`: spawn `loams dev --listen 127.0.0.1:0` with a temp data dir; `GetInstance` and a `_system:insert` then `_system:get` over the Live listener succeed with no PD running.
- `live_store_tikv_requires_feature`: built without `live-tikv`, `--live-store tikv://…` fails with `--live-store tikv:// needs a build with the live-tikv feature`.
- `live_pd_alias_maps_to_tikv_store`.
- `data_survives_restart_on_embedded`: insert, stop, restart, get.
- `default_build_has_no_tikv_client`: `cargo tree -p loams -e normal` with default features contains no `tikv-client` (a CI script assertion).

**Steps:** tests first; then the features, the flag and the defaults; then run `cargo test -p loams --test live_dev`.

**Commit:** `live: run Live on the embedded store by default; --live-store selects TiKV`.

## LV1a — Gates, functions, deploy and schema

### Task 1: The reactive correctness checker

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/testing/{workload.rs,checker.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/reactive_checker.rs`.

**Consumes:** `Runner`, `Subscriptions`, `Sessions`, `ClientState`, `Subscriptions::drop_next_batch` (the existing test hook), `loams_kv::testing::stores()`.

**Produces:**

```rust
pub struct Workload { pub seed: u64, pub sessions: usize, pub tables: usize, pub ops: usize, pub disturb: Vec<Disturbance> }
pub enum Disturbance { Deploy { at_op: usize }, Rollback { at_op: usize }, AddIndex { at_op: usize }, DropIndex { at_op: usize },
                       IdentityChange { at_op: usize }, NodeKill { at_op: usize } }   // variants wired by Tasks 7, 9, 17, 24
pub struct Report { pub transitions: usize, pub checked: usize, pub violations: Vec<Violation> }
pub async fn run_reactive_checker(store: Store, w: Workload) -> Report;
```

Checks (§20 §14 item 3):
- every Transition's updated query equals a fresh snapshot evaluation at the Transition's `end.ts`;
- versions strictly increase per session;
- every committed mutation that touches a subscribed range is reflected by the first tick at or after its commit;
- a resumed session converges.

**Tests:**
- `reactive_checker_passes_seeded_workload` (10 seeds × 2 000 ops, both backends).
- `reactive_checker_detects_missed_invalidation`: with `drop_next_batch` armed, the checker reports at least one violation (the checker is not vacuous).
- `reactive_checker_resume_converges`: sessions disconnected mid-run resume and match.

**Steps:** write the tests against a stub `run_reactive_checker` (fail), implement the workload and the checker, run on embedded, then on TiKV.

**Commit:** `live: the reactive correctness checker`.

### Task 2: The transaction checker

**Files:** `crates/loams-sim/src/elle.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/txn_checker.rs`.

**Consumes:** `Runner::mutate` with `_system:*` functions; `RunnerOptions::serializable_ranges`.

**Produces:**
- `loams_sim::elle::{History, Op, check_list_append(&History) -> Result<(), Anomaly>}`: dependency-graph cycle search for G0, G1c and G-single, plus G2 reported separately;
- a list-append workload over Live documents.

**Tests:**
- `elle_detects_known_g_single` and `elle_detects_known_g2_write_skew`: fixed bad histories are flagged.
- `elle_accepts_known_si_history`.
- `live_histories_are_snapshot_isolated` (both backends, 5 seeds).
- `point_read_promotion_prevents_write_skew`: the `db.get`-based write-skew workload shows no G2.
- `range_write_skew_is_possible_without_serializable_ranges`: documents Q31. The test asserts that the anomaly **can** occur with the option off (so the docs stay honest) and never occurs with it on.

**Steps:** tests first with the fixed histories, then the checker, then the workload.

**Commit:** `sim: an Elle-style list-append checker`; `live: the transaction checker`.

### Task 3: `loams-live-js`: the QuickJS runtime (R1 Task 13, part 1)

**Files:** `crates/loams-live-js/{Cargo.toml,src/{lib.rs,runtime.rs,prelude.js,limits.rs}}`, `tests/{functions.rs,limits.rs,determinism.rs}`.

**Consumes:** `loams_live::{Function, FnKind, LiveTxn, LiveValue, LiveError, Limits}`.

**Produces** (R1 Task 13's contract, verbatim where it exists):

```rust
pub struct JsConfig { pub memory_limit: usize /* 64 MiB */, pub cpu_limit: Duration /* 1 s */, pub contexts: usize /* 4 */,
                      pub console_lines: usize /* 64 */, pub console_line_bytes: usize /* 4 KiB */ }
pub struct Bundle;   // one ES module; exports from "loams:server"
impl Bundle { pub fn load(source: &str, config: JsConfig) -> Result<Self, LiveError>;
              pub fn functions(&self) -> Vec<FunctionMeta>;          // path, kind, visibility, args validator
              pub fn function(&self, path: &str) -> Option<Arc<dyn Function>>; }
pub struct FunctionMeta { pub path: String, pub kind: FnKind, pub visibility: Visibility, pub args: Option<Validator> }
pub enum Visibility { Public, Internal }
```

Semantics as R1 Task 13 items 1–3:
- the determinism rules (`Date.now` is the start ts; `Math.random` is a seeded PRNG; `crypto.*` throws `DeterminismError`; no `setTimeout`, `fetch` or `WebAssembly`);
- one context per invocation;
- frozen globals;
- the CPU interrupt (`FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`) and the memory limit (`FUNCTION_OUT_OF_MEMORY`).

`console.*` output is collected per call into `CallOutput.logs` (truncated per D682).

**Tests** (R1's names):
- `functions.rs`: `query_and_mutation_run_and_record_read_sets`, `mutation_rerun_on_conflict_is_invisible_to_the_caller`, `unknown_function_is_not_found`.
- `limits.rs`: `busy_loop_times_out`, `allocation_bomb_hits_memory_limit`, `context_recovers_after_timeout`, `console_output_truncated_at_limits`.
- `determinism.rs`: `module_state_does_not_leak_between_calls`, `crypto_random_throws_in_queries_and_mutations`, `date_now_is_start_ts`, `random_is_repeatable_for_same_ts_and_request`, `no_fetch_no_timers`.

**Steps:** tests first; add `rquickjs` to the workspace; implement the runtime, then the prelude, then the limits.

**Commit:** `live: run query and mutation functions in QuickJS`.

### Task 4: The host API: `ctx.db`, pagination, argument validators, visibility

**Files:** `crates/loams-live-js/src/{host.rs,validators.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/src/{cursor.rs,validate.rs}`, `tests/validators.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/cursor.rs`.

**Consumes:** Task 3; `LiveTxn::{get, query, insert, patch, replace, delete}`.

**Produces:**
- `ctx.db.get/query/insert/patch/replace/delete`, `withIndex(name, q => q.eq().gt().gte().lt().lte())`, `order`, `take`, `first`, `collect`, `paginate({ cursor, numItems })` returning `{ page, continueCursor, isDone }`;
- `loams_live::cursor::{encode(app_key, range_end) -> String, decode(app_key, &str) -> Result<KeyBound, LiveError>}`: base64url of `version:u8 ‖ index_id ‖ last_key ‖ HMAC-SHA256(app_key)[..16]`; the per-app key is a catalog record created with the app;
- `loams_live::validate::{Validator, check(&Validator, &LiveValue) -> Result<(), Vec<FieldViolation>>}`, shared by argument and schema validators (`v.null|int64|float64|boolean|string|bytes|array|object|literal|union|optional|any|id(table)`);
- `Function` gains `fn visibility(&self) -> Visibility` and receives a `CallCtx { identity: Option<Identity>, request_id, deployment }`. `Identity` is defined in Task 16; until then `None`.

**Tests:**
- `paginate_returns_pages_and_is_done`;
- `paginate_read_set_ends_at_last_key` (an insert after the page's last key does not invalidate the page subscription);
- `forged_cursor_rejected` (one bit flipped → `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, reason `live_bad_cursor`);
- `cursor_from_other_app_rejected`;
- `args_validator_rejects_before_handler_runs` (the handler's side counter is unchanged);
- `validator_vocabulary_roundtrip` (proptest: values generated from a validator pass it; mutated values fail with the right path);
- `internal_function_metadata_is_internal`.

**Steps:** tests first; the validator, then the cursor, then the host bindings.

**Commit:** `live: the function host API with pagination and argument validators`.

### Task 5: The isolated worker

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/worker/v1/worker.proto`, `crates/loams-live-js/src/{worker.rs,ipc.rs,sandbox_linux.rs}` (and `child.rs`, `bin/loams-live-worker.rs`, row T5-7), `crates/loams/src/main.rs` (hidden subcommand `live-worker`), `crates/loams-live-js/tests/{worker.rs,sandbox.rs}`.

**Consumes:** Tasks 3–4.

**Produces:**
- `enum Isolation { InProcess, Isolated }` in `JsConfig`;
- `WorkerPool::spawn(app, bundle_bytes, config) -> WorkerHandle` (one worker per (node, app, deployment));
- the protocol (Ruling 5): `Load{bundle}`, `Invoke{path, args, ctx}` → zero or more `HostCall{id, op, …}` / `HostReply{id, …}` → `Done{result | error, logs, cpu_ns}`.
- **Linux sandbox**, applied after `Load`:
  - `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`;
  - a landlock ruleset with no filesystem access;
  - a seccomp allowlist (read and write on fds 0–2, `futex`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `mprotect`, `brk`, `clock_gettime`, `exit_group`, `rt_sigreturn`, `sched_yield`, `madvise`), anything else `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`;
  - `RLIMIT_AS` = memory limit + 64 MiB;
  - `RLIMIT_NOFILE` = 3.
- `[live] isolation = "in_process" | "isolated"` and `[live] tenancy = "single" | "multi"`. `multi` with `in_process`, or `multi` on a non-Linux OS, refuses to start: `live: tenancy = "multi" needs isolation = "isolated" (Linux only)`.
- **A wall-clock kill (row T3-10):** the host kills a worker whose call runs past `cpu_limit` plus a grace (500 ms), from outside the process, answers the call `FUNCTION_TIMEOUT` and respawns the worker. QuickJS's C built-ins loop without polling the interrupt handler (row T3-7), so the in-process slots cannot bound every call's CPU; they run trusted, single-tenant code only, and multi-tenant serving needs this kill.

**Tests:**
- `functions_suite_runs_isolated`: every Task 3 and 4 test, parameterized, also passes with `Isolated`.
- `worker_cannot_open_files`: a test-only host hook asks the worker to `open("/etc/passwd")`; the worker dies with `SIGSYS` and the call returns `FUNCTION_ERROR`, reason `live_worker_crashed`.
- `worker_cannot_open_sockets`.
- `worker_cannot_exec`.
- `worker_crash_is_function_error_and_respawns`: the next call succeeds on a fresh worker.
- `five_crashes_in_a_minute_degrade_the_deployment`.
- `multi_tenancy_requires_isolation`: config validation.
- `stuck_builtin_is_killed_by_the_wall_clock`: a call stuck in a C built-in loop that ignores the interrupt handler (for example `JSON.stringify` of a huge sparse array with a raised memory limit) is killed after `cpu_limit` plus the grace, answers `FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`, and the next call succeeds on a fresh worker.
- `host_call_latency_recorded`: a bench-style test that records the p50 IPC round trip into the test output; not a gate, but it feeds P8.

**Steps:** tests first (the Linux-only tests are `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`), then the protocol, then the worker loop, then the sandbox.

**Commit:** `live: run functions in a sandboxed worker process`.

### Task 6: Deployments: records, storage and activation

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{deploy.rs,schema.rs}`, `proto/loams/live/v1/catalog.proto`, `crates/loams-live/tests/deploy.rs` (and, row T6-9, `crates/loams-live-js/src/loader.rs`, `crates/loams-live/src/service.rs`, `crates/loams/src/server.rs`).

**Consumes:** `loams-store` (bundles at `live/<app>/deployments/<id>.js`, R1 Ruling 10); `catalog.rs`; Tasks 3–5.

**Produces:**

```rust
pub struct DeploymentRecord { pub id: Ulid, pub bundle_sha256: [u8; 32], pub schema: Schema, pub created_at_ms: u64,
                              pub created_by: String, pub message: String, pub parent: Option<Ulid>, pub state: DeploymentState }
pub enum DeploymentState { Pending, Validating, Backfilling, Active, Superseded, Failed { reason: String }, Degraded }
pub struct DeployRequest { pub bundle: Vec<u8>, pub schema: Schema, pub expected_active: Option<Ulid>, pub message: String, pub dry_run: bool }
pub async fn deploy(app: &AppEngine, req: DeployRequest, by: &Principal) -> Result<DeployOutcome, LiveError>;
pub async fn list_deployments(app: &AppEngine, page: PageRequest) -> Result<Page<DeploymentRecord>, LiveError>;
pub fn resolve(app: &AppEngine, name: &str) -> Result<Arc<dyn Function>, LiveError>;  // system, else active deployment
```

Semantics are §45 §3.3:
- validate in a scratch runtime;
- store the bundle and check its hash on read;
- write `pending`;
- apply the schema (Tasks 8–9; in this task only additive table creation);
- CAS the pointer against `expected_active` (on mismatch, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_deploy_conflict`);
- keep 50, and let the janitor delete older bundles.

`SubKey` gains `deployment: Ulid` (the nil ULID for system functions).

**Tests:**
- `deploy_swaps_functions_for_new_calls` (R1's name);
- `concurrent_deploys_one_wins`;
- `dry_run_writes_nothing`;
- `bundle_hash_mismatch_refused_and_previous_keeps_serving` (corrupt the stored object);
- `invalid_bundle_fails_without_pointer_change`;
- `retention_keeps_fifty_and_the_active_parent`;
- `system_functions_survive_any_deploy`.

**Steps:** tests first; records and protos, then storage, then the CAS, then retention.

**Commit:** `live: versioned deployments with compare-and-swap activation`.

### Task 7: Rollback and activation semantics

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/deploy.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/deploy.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/reactive_checker.rs` (and, row T7-8, `crates/loams-live/src/{subs.rs,session.rs,service.rs,txn.rs,lib.rs,testing/checker.rs,testing/mod.rs}`).

**Consumes:** Task 6; `Subscriptions`.

**Produces:**
- `pub async fn activate(app: &AppEngine, id: Ulid, expected_active: Option<Ulid>, by: &Principal) -> Result<DeployOutcome, LiveError>`, which re-runs the deploy path with the stored bundle and schema (§45 §3.3: no special path);
- at the activation tick, every subscription of the app reruns once on the new deployment.

**Tests:**
- `rollback_restores_previous_functions`;
- `rollback_reapplies_previous_schema` (an index added by the later deployment is dropped; checked after Task 9 lands, with an `#[ignore]` reason until then that Task 9 removes);
- `activation_reruns_every_subscription_once` (the rerun counter rises by exactly the number of distinct `SubKey`s);
- `no_session_sees_mixed_deployments` (each Transition's results all carry one deployment id, via a test hook);
- `reactive_checker_with_deploys_and_rollbacks` (the Task 1 checker with `Disturbance::{Deploy, Rollback}`).

**Steps:** tests first; then activation and the rerun-all at the tick.

**Commit:** `live: rollback by activating an earlier deployment`.

### Task 8: Schema validators

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{schema.rs,validate.rs,backfill.rs}`, `proto/loams/live/v1/catalog.proto` (`TableDef.validator`, `TableDef.enforcing`, `TableJobRecord`, `TableJobKind`, `JobFinding`; `Validator`, `TableSchema.validator` and `schema_validation` are in `live.proto`, row T8-1), `crates/loams-live/tests/schema.rs` (and, rows T8-1 and T8-8, `proto/loams/live/v1/live.proto`, `crates/loams-live/src/{catalog.rs,keys.rs,docs.rs,journal.rs,txn.rs,deploy.rs,error.rs,value.rs,service.rs,lib.rs}`, `docs/api/reasons.md` and the regenerated SDK files).

**Consumes:** Task 4's `Validator`; `docs.rs` write paths; the worker lease (`loams-meta` leases in cluster mode, an in-process lease in dev).

**Produces:**
- `backfill::TableJob`, a leased, checkpointed, rate-limited scan of one table's documents in batches. The validation scan here and the index backfill of Task 9 both use it;
- validator enforcement on every write (including `_system:*`): `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, reason `live_schema_violation`, with `field_violations`;
- tightening a validator: state `enforcing`, then the validation scan (a backfill-style job with deployment state `validating`); a violation fails the deploy, reverts the validator, and reports up to 100 ids;
- loosening applies at once;
- `schemaValidation: false` skips the scan.

**Tests:**
- `write_violating_validator_refused`;
- `system_insert_is_validated_too`;
- `tightening_with_valid_data_succeeds`;
- `tightening_with_invalid_data_fails_and_reverts` (the deploy is `Failed`, the old validator is active, and the error lists the offending ids);
- `loosening_skips_scan`;
- `schema_validation_false_skips_scan_but_checks_writes`;
- `writes_during_validation_scan_are_checked`.

**Steps:** tests first; enforcement, then the scan, then the deploy states.

**Commit:** `live: schema validators enforced on writes and checked on deploy`.

### Task 9: Online index changes

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{backfill.rs,catalog.rs,txn.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/backfill.rs`.

**Consumes:** `catalog.rs` index definitions; `Runner::mutate`; `loams_kv::Store::run`; Task 8's `backfill::TableJob`.

**Produces:**
- `IndexState { WriteOnly { since: Ts }, Backfilling { checkpoint: Vec<u8> }, Ready, Dropping { since: Ts } }` in `IndexDef`;
- `RunnerOptions.max_mutation_lifetime` (default = `Limits::mutation_deadline`). Before prewrite, a mutation fetches `store.now()` and returns `TxnError::NotApplied("mutation lifetime exceeded")` (a retry) if `now.physical_ms() − start.physical_ms() > max_mutation_lifetime` (Ruling 9);
- the backfill job: wait until `since + 2 × lifetime`; then batches of 256 documents, each batch one transaction that reads, calls `lock_keys` on the document keys and puts the index entries; a checkpoint in the catalog; rate `backfill_docs_per_s` (5 000);
- `GetIndexStatus { state, done, total_estimate }`;
- queries on a non-ready index fail with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_index_not_ready`;
- drops: `Dropping`, then the wait, then a batched range delete, then the definition is removed;
- **retires R1 Ruling 5 and the row T9-1 quiesce gate** (`Runner::try_quiesce` is deleted).

**Tests:**
- `mutation_older_than_lifetime_refuses_to_prewrite` (a fault plan delays one mutation past the lifetime; it retries with a new start ts and commits);
- `index_add_on_non_empty_table_backfills` (10 000 docs; afterwards `withIndex` returns every doc in order);
- `concurrent_inserts_during_backfill_are_indexed` (an insert and patch loop runs throughout; the final index equals a rebuild from documents);
- `query_on_backfilling_index_is_failed_precondition`;
- `backfill_resumes_after_crash` (the job is killed mid-way; a new job resumes from the checkpoint; no duplicates and no gaps);
- `drop_index_deletes_entries_after_wait`;
- `checker_passes_with_index_changes_mid_workload` (Task 1 with `AddIndex` and `DropIndex`);
- `try_quiesce_is_gone` (a compile-level check through the public API surface snapshot).

**Steps:** tests first; the lifetime rule, then the states, then the job, then drops; then remove the quiesce gate.

**Commit:** `live: online index changes with a lifetime wait and a leased backfill`.

### Task 10: `LiveAdminService` (deploy half) and function logs

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/v1/{admin.proto,live.proto}`, `crates/loams-live/src/{admin.rs,logs.rs,service.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/service.rs`, `sdks/typescript/packages/live/src/gen/` (regenerated).

**Consumes:** Tasks 6–9.

**Produces:**
- `service LiveAdminService { Deploy; ListDeployments; GetDeployment; ActivateDeployment; GetIndexStatus; TailLogs (server stream) }` with `loams.options.v1.module = { name: "live.admin", unstable: true }`;
- `LiveService.Deploy` **removed** (Ruling 6, D689);
- `logs::Ring` per app per node (10 000 lines), `TailLogs{follow, since_ms, function?}`, fed by `CallOutput.logs` with `{ts, request_id, function, level, line}`;
- `LiveService.Deploy`'s facade entry in `loams.tables` moves to `loams.live.admin.deploy` (the facade regenerates).

**Tests:**
- `deploy_over_admin_service_roundtrip` (Connect JSON and binary);
- `live_service_has_no_deploy` (the reflection service lists no `Deploy` on `LiveService`);
- `tail_logs_streams_console_output_with_request_ids`;
- `tail_logs_filters_by_function`;
- `logs_ring_drops_oldest_and_counts`.

**Steps:** proto first, `buf lint`, regenerate; tests; handlers.

**Commit:** `live: LiveAdminService with deploy, rollback, index status and logs`.

### Task 11: `catalog` journal entries

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/v1/journal.proto` (`JournalEntry.catalog: CatalogChange`), `crates/loams-live/src/{journal.rs,subs.rs,catalog.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/journal.rs`.

**Consumes:** the journal and tailer (R1 Task 9).

**Produces:**
- every catalog write (table create, index state change, validator change, deployment activation, app settings) appends a journal entry with `catalog: { kind, table_id?, deployment? }` in the same transaction;
- the subscription manager reloads the catalog at the tick that contains it, before matching data writes of the same tick;
- the backup exporter (Task 29) consumes the same entries.

**Tests:**
- `catalog_entry_written_with_each_catalog_change`;
- `tailer_reloads_catalog_at_the_tick`;
- `data_write_after_index_change_in_same_tick_uses_new_catalog`.

**Steps:** tests first; proto; writers; tailer reload.

**Commit:** `live: record catalog changes in the commit journal`.

## LV1b — Apps, exposure and auth

### Task 12: Live on the main Connect port

**Files:** `crates/loams/src/api/{connect.rs,live.rs}`, `crates/loams/src/server.rs`, `crates/loams-live/src/{service.rs,system.rs}`, `crates/loams/tests/live_connect.rs`.

**Consumes:** `CATALOGUE`, `LiveAbsent`, the main router's `register`; `LiveServer`.

**Produces:**
- with the `live` feature and Live configured, `LiveService` and `LiveAdminService` are registered on the main port (replacing `LiveAbsent`) and `CATALOGUE`'s `loams.live.v1` row reports `available: true` (still `unstable: true`); without the feature, `LiveAbsent` stays;
- `--live-listen` keeps serving the same services, loopback only, and prints `--live-listen is deprecated; Live is served on --listen (D688)`;
- `_system:tables` if Task 0 found AP1e Task 20 unmerged, with AP1e's contract.

**Tests:**
- `live_on_main_port_over_connect_grpc_and_grpc_web`;
- `get_instance_reports_live_available`;
- `live_absent_without_feature`;
- `live_listen_flag_warns_and_serves`;
- `system_tables_lists_created_tables` and `system_tables_via_mutate_refused` (only if added here).

**Steps:** tests first; registration; flag handling.

**Commit:** `api: serve Loams Live on the main Connect port`.

### Task 13: The app directory and app lifecycle

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{apps.rs,engines.rs,admin.rs}`, `proto/loams/live/v1/{admin.proto,catalog.proto}` (`AppRecord`, `CreateApp`, `ListApps`, `GetApp`, `UpdateApp`, `DeleteApp`), `crates/loams-live/tests/apps.rs`.

**Consumes:** `loams_kv::Store` (the system keyspace `loams_live_system`); `loams_tikv::ensure_keyspace` (tikv backend) or the embedded keyspace table.

**Produces:**
- `AppRecord { id: u32, name, namespace, keyspace, state: Active | Disabled | Deleting { purge_after_ms }, limits, issuers, allowed_origins, allow_anonymous, cursor_key_ref, created_at_ms }`;
- `Apps::{create, get_by_name, list, update, delete}`. `create` ensures the keyspace `loams_live_a<id>` **before** writing the record;
- `Engines`: lazily started `AppEngine { runner, subs, sessions, runtime, tailer }` per app, stopped after 10 minutes idle;
- the header `loams-live-app` resolves the app; the default app is the server's `--live-app`;
- `DeleteApp`: `Disabled` plus the keyspace disabled (TiKV), a backup first (once Task 29 lands; until then a recorded TODO ruling), and a purge after 7 days.

**Tests:**
- `create_list_get_update_app`;
- `create_app_creates_keyspace_first` (a fault after `ensure_keyspace` leaves no record and an orphan the janitor reports);
- `engine_starts_lazily_and_stops_when_idle` (paused time);
- `two_apps_never_see_each_others_documents`;
- `disabled_app_refuses_calls` (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_app_disabled`);
- `deleted_app_purged_after_retention`;
- `max_apps_per_cluster_enforced`.

**Steps:** tests first; the directory, then the engines, then the header routing.

**Commit:** `live: an app directory and many apps per node`.

### Task 14: The verifier

> **Superseded by rulings T14-1..T14-3** (2026-10-16): no verification core is built. Live's identity is `loams_live::auth::Caller`, filled by the engine's authentication layer (`api::live::live_caller`, from `auth::Principal` and its `Grant`), and `Caller::unauthenticated()` when no principal was admitted. The text below is kept as the original brief.

**Files:** if `loams-auth` exists, adapt to it in `crates/loams-live/src/auth.rs` only. Otherwise also `crates/loams-auth/{Cargo.toml,src/{lib.rs,verify.rs,keys.rs,jwks.rs,revocation.rs}}` and `crates/loams-auth/tests/verify.rs`.

**Consumes:** the instance signing keys and JWKS (§19 §5.3) or a config `[auth] jwks = "<path or url>"`; API key records (`KeyStore`).

**Produces** (the verification core only, named as MT1 names it so that MT1 and M2 extend it):

```rust
pub struct Verifier { /* instance issuer + JWKS cache + KeyStore + revocation set */ }
pub enum Principal { User { id, org, env }, ServiceAccount { id, org, env }, Agent { id, org, env, act: Vec<String> } }
pub struct Verified { pub principal: Principal, pub scopes: BTreeSet<String>, pub expires_at_ms: u64, pub token_id: String }
impl Verifier { pub async fn verify_bearer(&self, header: &str) -> Result<Verified, AuthError>; }
#[async_trait] pub trait KeyStore: Send + Sync { async fn lookup(&self, key_id: &str) -> Result<Option<KeyRecord>, AuthError>; }
pub struct KeyRecord { pub hash: [u8; 32] /* argon2id or SHA-256 per §18 §6 */, pub org, pub env, pub scopes, pub expires_at_ms, pub revoked: bool }
pub trait Revocations: Send + Sync { fn is_revoked(&self, token_id: &str) -> bool; fn subscribe(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<String>; }
```

Rules:
- EdDSA only for Loams tokens; 60 s leeway; `env` required;
- API keys compared in constant time;
- a key cache of 30 s (§10 §4);
- **no issuance** (no token endpoint, no key creation).

In standalone without the `ControlStore`, a file-backed `KeyStore` (`[auth] keys_file`, hashed entries) lets operators run Live with API keys before M2. It is documented as the interim.

**Tests:**
- `valid_loams_token_verifies`;
- `expired_rejected_with_60s_leeway`;
- `wrong_issuer_rejected`;
- `alg_none_and_hs256_rejected`;
- `api_key_verifies_and_hash_compare_is_constant_time` (a code-level check that `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` is used);
- `revoked_key_rejected_within_cache_ttl`;
- `tampered_payload_rejected` (proptest).

**Steps:** tests first; the verifier; the file `KeyStore`.

**Commit:** `auth: the token and API key verification core` (only if built); `live: verify Live credentials`.

### Task 15: Authorization: scopes, `Authorizer` actions and the matrix

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/authz.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/{authz.rs,authz_matrix.expected.md}`.

**Consumes:** Task 14's `Verified` (as built: `loams_live::auth::Caller`, row T14-3); the `Authorizer` trait (D66) if it exists, else `authz::Authorizer` with the same `check(principal, action, resource)` signature and an `AllowAll` plus a static role-binding implementation from config (the interim).

**Produces:**
- the app fence: an env-scoped credential's app must equal the addressed app, else `PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `live_app_mismatch`;
- scope and action checks per §45 §5.2 (`live:call|read|write|deploy|admin`; `live_app:<app>`, `live_table:<app>/<table>`);
- `_system:*` reads and writes check the table;
- internal functions need `live:call` **and** a platform principal;
- end users (Task 16) may call only public functions;
- audit records (`audit=true` log lines until `_audit` exists).

**Tests:**
- `authz_matrix`: generates every combination of credential kind {none, end user, user token, service account, API key, agent} × scope set × app match {same, other} × target {public fn, internal fn, `_system:get`, `_system:insert`, admin Deploy, admin UpdateApp} × RPC {Query, Mutate, Watch, admin}, runs each against a server, and compares the outcomes (`allowed` or the exact code and reason) with the blessed `authz_matrix.expected.md`. `LOAMS_BLESS=1` rewrites the file, and a reviewer reads the diff.
- `other_app_credential_denied`;
- `table_level_read_grant_limits_system_query`;
- `audit_line_for_deploy_and_system_write`.

**Steps:** write the matrix test and an empty expected file (fail); implement; bless; review the table by hand against §45 §5.

**Commit:** `live: per-app and per-table authorization with a blessed matrix`.

### Task 16: App end users through OIDC

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/auth.rs` (issuers per app), `crates/loams-live-js/src/host.rs` (`ctx.auth`), `crates/loams-live/tests/identity.rs`, `.github/workflows/identity.yml` (a Zitadel case, if IA1's job exists).

**Consumes:** `AppRecord.issuers`; MT1 Task 2's `TrustedIssuers` if merged (else the same rules implemented here: discovery, a 10-minute JWKS cache, a refresh on unknown `kid` at most every 30 s).

**Produces:**
- `Identity { issuer, subject, token_identifier /* issuer|subject */, email, name, claims: LiveValue }`;
- bearer classification per §45 §5.3: the instance issuer means a platform principal; an issuer configured on the app means an end user; the `loams_` prefix means an API key; else `UNAUTHENTICATED`;
- `allow_anonymous`;
- `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.

**Tests:**
- `end_user_token_from_configured_issuer_calls_public_function` (a local test issuer with a generated key serving discovery and JWKS);
- `end_user_cannot_call_internal_or_system_or_admin`;
- `token_from_unconfigured_issuer_rejected`;
- `ctx_auth_returns_identity_claims`;
- `anonymous_allowed_only_when_configured`;
- `jwks_refresh_rate_limited`;
- `oidc_end_user_e2e` (in the `identity` job, against IA1's compose stack: a Zitadel-issued token calls a public function; skipped where the stack is absent).

**Steps:** tests first; classification; issuers; `ctx.auth`.

**Commit:** `live: app end users authenticate with OIDC tokens`.

### Task 17: Session identity

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/v1/live.proto` (`rpc Authenticate(AuthenticateRequest) returns (AuthenticateResponse)`), `crates/loams-live/src/{session.rs,subs.rs,service.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/identity.rs`.

**Consumes:** Tasks 14–16; `StateVersion.identity`; `SubKey`.

**Produces:**
- `Watch` reads its identity from `Authorization`;
- `Authenticate{session_id}`: the same subject extends the expiry; a different subject increments `identity`, reruns all of the session's queries at the next tick, and sends a Transition with the new identity version;
- expiry plus 60 s closes the stream with `UNAUTHENTICATED`, reason `token_expired`;
- revocation closes the sessions of a revoked token or key within the feed latency;
- 24 h rotation closes the stream with `UNAVAILABLE`, reason `session_rotate`;
- `SubKey { deployment, function, args_digest, identity }` with `identity = token_identifier | principal id | "anonymous"`.

**Tests:**
- `authenticate_same_subject_extends_without_rerun`;
- `authenticate_new_subject_bumps_identity_and_reruns`;
- `expired_session_closed_with_token_expired` (paused time);
- `revoked_key_closes_sessions`;
- `stream_rotates_after_24h`;
- `results_never_shared_across_identities` (two users watch one `ctx.auth`-dependent query; each sees only their own result; the cache holds two entries);
- `reactive_checker_with_identity_changes` (Task 1 with `IdentityChange`).

**Steps:** proto; tests; the session state; `SubKey`.

**Commit:** `live: authenticated sessions with identity versions, expiry and rotation`.

### Task 18: TLS, the non-loopback rule and CORS

**Files:** `crates/loams/src/{server.rs,api/connect.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/src/config.rs`, `crates/loams/tests/live_exposure.rs`.

**Consumes:** the main port's TLS config if MT1 Task 7 merged; else `[tls] cert_file, key_file, client_ca?` with rustls, implemented exactly to MT1 Task 7's rule and message.

**Produces:**
- the non-loopback rule (`<listener> listen on <addr>: non-loopback addresses need [tls] and [auth] (MT1)`);
- `[tls] terminated_by_proxy = true` with `trusted_proxies` (the port's setting);
- a CORS layer: preflight answered for the union of active apps' `allowed_origins`; actual requests re-checked against the addressed app (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `live_origin_not_allowed`); never `Allow-Credentials`;
- R1's `check_listen` refusal remains only on the deprecated `--live-listen`.

**Tests:**
- `non_loopback_without_tls_and_auth_refused`;
- `non_loopback_with_tls_and_auth_starts` (a self-signed cert generated in the test);
- `cors_preflight_allows_union_of_origins`;
- `cors_actual_request_checked_per_app`;
- `no_allow_credentials_header`.

**Steps:** tests first; then TLS (if absent), the rule and the CORS layer.

**Commit:** `api: TLS and CORS for Live beyond loopback`.

### Task 19: Error scrubbing and edge limits

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{error.rs,service.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/service.rs`.

**Consumes:** `LiveError`, `connect_error`; §20 §11.4 (raw keys in `tikv-client` errors).

**Produces:**
- every `LiveError::Internal` and `Txn` message reaching a client is scrubbed of byte strings that look like keys, and replaced by a request id the operator can find in the logs;
- `ErrorInfo.reason` set on every Live error (registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`);
- request message size limits (arguments 4 MiB, bundle 16 MiB on the admin service) enforced before decoding;
- **`QueryRequest.ts` (and any client-supplied read timestamp) validated at the service edge on both backends** (Task 21 review, row T21-14): a timestamp ahead of the store's clock is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, before it reaches `Store::snapshot`. The embedded store already refuses one more than 1 s ahead (`KvError::TsAhead`); TiKV does not refuse it, and a far-future read there pushes the max-ts that commits must exceed.

**Tests:**
- `future_read_ts_refused_at_the_edge` (a `Query` at `u64::MAX` and one years ahead → `INVALID_ARGUMENT` on both backends; the store's clock unchanged);
- `tikv_errors_never_leak_raw_keys` (an injected TiKV error containing a key → the client message has none, and the server log has the request id);
- `every_live_reason_is_registered` (a scan of the code's reason constants against `docs/api/reasons.md`);
- `oversized_arguments_refused_before_decode`.

**Steps:** tests first; then scrubbing, reasons and limits.

**Commit:** `live: scrub internal errors and register Live error reasons`.

---

## LV1d — HA and operations

### Task 24: Multi-node sessions

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/forward.rs`, `crates/loams/src/api/internal.rs` (or `loams.internal.v1`, as API1 built it), `crates/loams-live/tests/multinode.rs`.

**Consumes:** M1.3's request forwarding over the cluster listener; `session_id` node prefixes; Task 11.

**Produces:**
- `ModifyQuerySet` and `Authenticate` for a session owned by another node are forwarded over the cluster listener (internal port only, cluster-token or mTLS authenticated as the port already is);
- an unknown or dead owner gives `NOT_FOUND`, reason `session_gone`;
- draining: on `SIGTERM`, readiness goes false, streams close with `UNAVAILABLE`, reason `node_draining`, in-flight mutations finish within their deadline, and the process exits.

**Tests** (two `LiveServer`s in process on one store; both backends):
- `modify_on_other_node_is_forwarded`;
- `authenticate_on_other_node_is_forwarded`;
- `dead_owner_gives_session_gone`;
- `deploy_on_one_node_reaches_the_other_at_the_same_tick`;
- `drain_closes_streams_with_node_draining`;
- `reactive_checker_with_node_kill` (Task 1 with `NodeKill`: clients resume on the survivor).

**Steps:** tests first; forwarding; draining.

**Commit:** `live: serve sessions across several Live nodes`.

### Task 25: The nemesis

**Files:** `scripts/tikv/{nemesis.sh,playground.sh}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/nemesis.rs` (`#[ignore]`, run by the job), `.github/workflows/live-nightly.yml`.

**Consumes:** Tasks 1, 2 and 24; `toxiproxy`.

**Produces:**
- `playground.sh start --topology ha` (3 PD, 3 TiKV, 2 Live nodes behind toxiproxy);
- `nemesis.sh` with faults:
  - kill and restart a TiKV store;
  - kill the PD leader;
  - stall PD for 3 s (R1 Task 2 rulings);
  - kill a Live node;
  - partition a Live node from TiKV;
  - `SIGSTOP` and `SIGCONT` a TiKV store;
- a nightly job (30 min) and a release job (24 h) that run both checkers throughout.

**Tests:**
- `nemesis_reactive_and_txn_checkers_pass` (the job's single test; the report lists the faults applied and the violations, which must be empty);
- `nemesis_script_selftest` (each fault applies and heals within 30 s, run once with no workload).

**Steps:** the script and self-test first; then the job; run a 30-minute local run between builds.

**Commit:** `ci: a nightly nemesis for Loams Live`.

### Task 26: `gc_blocked_seconds` and GC alerts

**Files:** `crates/loams-tikv/src/gc.rs`, `crates/loams-kv/src/embedded/gc.rs`, `crates/loams-tikv/tests/gc.rs`.

**Consumes:** the R1 Task 3 GC loop; R1 row T3-12.

**Produces:**
- the gauge `loams_live_gc_blocked_seconds{keyspace}` (registered through Task 27's registry);
- `loams_live_gc_safe_point_lag_seconds`;
- a per-keyspace failure counter;
- a log line naming the barrier that holds the safe point.

**Tests:**
- `blocked_keyspace_reports_seconds`;
- `barrier_holding_safe_point_is_named`;
- `embedded_gc_reports_same_metrics`.

**Carried from the Task 23 review** (do in this task):
- **Item 6, bounded token sweep.** Embedded GC's commit-token sweep reads every token key under every root and deletes the expired ones in one transaction per root. Bound it like the version GC (row T21-18): a batch of keys per transaction, with a resume cursor.
- **Item 9, the no-TiKV paths.** Test `loams-live` and `crates/loams` built without `tikv` and `live-tikv` in CI, beyond the default build's `cargo tree` check and the `loams-live --lib` clippy:
  - `LiveConfig` without `on_tikv` and `with_tikv`;
  - `TestStore::tikv()` skipping;
  - the server's Live path with no cluster GC loop.
- **Item 5, `Durability::None` (a suggestion to evaluate).** GC batches, and the oracle's mark writes, could commit with redb's `Durability::None`, then make one durable commit at the end of a round. That saves an fsync per batch. Their crash semantics must stay as they are: a lost batch is only re-done, but a mark must be durable before a timestamp above the old one is issued.

**Carried from the Task 1 review** (note for this task):
- **The reactive checker reads at old timestamps.** After a run, the checker evaluates every query at every recorded Transition's `end.ts` and at the ticks it checks, some minutes in the past on TiKV. At today's sizes (10 × 2 000 nightly, each seed on a fresh root and checked right after it runs) that stays inside the GC life time. Larger nightly sizes, a shorter GC life time, or a GC round that this task's alerts make more aggressive could move the safe point past those timestamps; the reads are then refused ("below the GC safe point") and show as `Stale` violations, not as GC errors. Before raising the sizes: have the checker hold a GC barrier (or a safe-point floor) at its first tick for the run, or check each seed's Transitions while the run is still within the life time, and make a below-safe-point refusal a `Workload` violation that names GC.

**Commit:** `tikv: report blocked GC per keyspace`.

### Task 27: Metrics, traces and logs

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/metrics.rs`, `crates/loams/src/server.rs` (registry and admin route if absent), `crates/loams-live/tests/observability.rs`, `deploy/live/alerts.yaml`.

**Consumes:** Task 0 item 4.

**Produces:**
- the metric set of §45 §11, named exactly as there, with only `app` as a high-cardinality label;
- per-function series behind `metrics.per_function`, capped at 50;
- OTLP spans: `live.rpc`, then `live.function` (attempt, kind, deployment), then `live.host_batch`, then `kv.txn` (begin, prewrite, commit events), and `live.tick` with links to the commits it served;
- structured JSON log fields `request_id`, `trace_id`, `app`, `function`, `deployment`, `principal`;
- `/debug/dump` Live section;
- Prometheus alert rules for §45 §11's alerts.

**Tests:**
- `metrics_exposed_with_expected_names` (scrape `/metrics`, assert every name in §45 §11);
- `metric_labels_bounded` (1 000 functions → at most 50 per-function series);
- `trace_links_rpc_to_txn` (an in-memory exporter);
- `canary_never_logged` (a document, argument and token containing `CANARY-7f3a` are written, read, failed and authenticated; no log line, span attribute or metric label contains it);
- `alerts_yaml_is_valid` (`promtool check rules` in CI).

**Steps:** tests first; registry (if absent); instrumentation; alerts.

**Commit:** `live: metrics, traces and structured logs`.

### Task 28: Quotas and rate limits

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/{quota.rs,limits.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/quota.rs`, the limits table source (D88).

**Consumes:** `AppRecord.limits`; Task 27 metrics.

**Produces:**
- token buckets per node for every quota in §45 §12;
- over a limit: `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, reason `live_quota_exceeded`, `metadata.quota`, `RetryInfo`;
- soft storage and document limits: an alert at 90%, refusing inserts at 100%;
- the limits page entries.

**Tests:**
- one pair per quota: `<quota>_at_limit_admitted` and `<quota>_past_limit_refused_with_retry_info`;
- `per_principal_rate_independent_of_app_rate`;
- `storage_soft_limit_refuses_inserts_not_deletes`;
- `limits_page_lists_every_live_limit` (the D88 render test).

**Commit:** `live: per-app and per-principal quotas`.

### Task 29: Backup: snapshot and continuous export

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/v1/{backup.proto,admin.proto}`, `crates/loams-live/src/backup.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/backup.rs`.

**Consumes:** `loams-store`; the journal consumer checkpoints (R1 Task 9); `Store::barrier`; Task 11's catalog entries.

**Produces:**
- `BackupManifest { backup_id, app, snapshot_ts, segments, changes_through_ts }` at `live/<app>/backups/<backup_id>/manifest.pb`;
- the snapshot: segments of up to 64 MiB (zstd) read at `snapshot_ts` under a barrier;
- the exporter: a journal consumer named `backup`. For each tick `T` it reads the documents named by new entries at `T` and appends `ChangeBatch { ts: T, upserts, deletes, catalog }` to `changes/<seq>.pb`. It flushes every 10 s or 8 MiB, and holds the janitor through its checkpoint;
- `CreateBackup` (a new snapshot) and `ListBackups`;
- daily snapshots, and pruning past the PITR window (7 days, Q636);
- the metric `loams_live_backup_export_lag_seconds{app}`.

**Tests:**
- `snapshot_is_consistent_at_ts` (concurrent writes during the snapshot; the snapshot equals a fresh read at `snapshot_ts`);
- `export_covers_every_committed_change` (a replay of the export from the snapshot equals the app at the last exported tick);
- `exporter_holds_the_journal_janitor`;
- `exporter_resumes_after_crash_without_gaps_or_duplicates`;
- `catalog_changes_exported_in_order`;
- both backends.

**Commit:** `live: per-app snapshot and continuous change export to the bucket`.

### Task 30: Restore and point-in-time recovery

**Files:** `crates/loams-live/src/restore.rs`, `crates/loams-live/tests/backup.rs`, `scripts/live/restore-drill.sh`.

**Consumes:** Task 29; Task 13 (`create`); Task 9 (index rebuild through backfill).

**Produces:**
- `Restore { backup_id, to_ts?, target_app, replace: bool }`: create the target app; load the snapshot; replay changes ≤ `to_ts`; rebuild indexes; restore the catalog and the active deployment; with `replace`, swap the directory names atomically (the old app becomes `<name>-replaced-<ts>`, disabled);
- the drill script (back up, write more, restore to a middle tick, compare).

**Tests:**
- `restore_matches_source_snapshot_at_tick` (the reactive checker's state comparison: every table and index equal);
- `pitr_to_middle_tick`;
- `restore_with_replace_swaps_atomically` (clients addressing the name see the old or the new app, never a mix);
- `restore_drill_script_passes` (in the nightly job, on TiKV).

**Commit:** `live: restore an app to a point in time`.

### Task 31: The BR spike and the cluster DR runbook

**Files:** `docs/plans/lv1-br-spike.md`, `scripts/tikv/br-drill.sh`, `docs/guides/live/backup.md`.

**Consumes:** Q37, Q627; the v8.5.8 `br` binary.

**Produces:**
- a spike report: whether `br backup txn` or `raw` and `br restore` cover an API v2 txn keyspace (Live and metastore keyspaces), per keyspace or only cluster-wide, and whether log backup (`br log start`) and PITR restore work for them, with the commands and outputs;
- if BR works, a nightly drill; if not, the runbook says that cluster DR is per-app logical restore of every app, in parallel, plus a metastore restore.

**Tests:** `br_drill` (nightly, only if the spike is positive; otherwise this task records the negative result as a ruling and the test is not created).

**Commit:** `docs: BR on API v2 txn keyspaces (spike) and the cluster DR runbook`.

### Task 32: Reference deployment

**Files:** `deploy/live/{compose.yaml,helm-values.yaml,README.md}`, `crates/loams/tests/live_probes.rs`.

**Consumes:** Tasks 24, 27.

**Produces:**
- a compose topology (3 PD, 3 TiKV with location labels, 2 Live nodes with the `live-tikv` build, an L7 proxy with a 60 s idle timeout, MinIO or RustFS for backups);
- the Live role's chart values: probes on `/health/live` and `/health/ready`, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` at least the mutation deadline plus 10 s, a pod anti-affinity rule, resources;
- a readiness check that is false until the app directory and the TiKV connection are healthy.

**Tests:**
- `readiness_false_until_store_connected`;
- `readiness_false_while_draining`;
- `compose_smoke` (in the nightly job: bring the stack up, run a 2-minute checker workload through the proxy, kill one Live node, check that the clients resume).

**Commit:** `deploy: a reference HA topology for Loams Live`.

### Task 33: The performance harness and gates

**Files:** `bench/live/{Cargo.toml,src/main.rs,scenarios/p01.toml … p15.toml,baseline.json,compare.py}`, `.github/workflows/live-nightly.yml`.

**Consumes:** §45 §15; the generated Rust client; Task 32's topology.

**Produces:**
- one scenario per gate P1–P15 with its measurement;
- JSON results `{gate, value, unit, p50, p99, rig}`;
- `compare.py` failing on a regression past each gate's threshold;
- the first run's numbers written to `baseline.json` and into the exit report for Q633.

**Tests:**
- `harness_selftest` (each scenario runs for 10 s against `loams dev` on the embedded store and emits a valid result);
- `compare_flags_regression` (a synthetic result past its threshold fails).

**Steps:** self-test first; scenarios; the baseline run on the reference rig (an owner action if the rig is not available: record it).

**Commit:** `bench: Loams Live performance gates`.

## LV1e — SDKs, docs, security and release

### Task 34: `@loams/live`, the reactive client (R1 Task 14)

**Files:** `sdks/typescript/packages/live/{package.json,src/{index.ts,client.ts,session.ts,optimistic.ts,values.ts,auth.ts,paginate.ts},test/{session.test.ts,values.test.ts,auth.test.ts,live.test.ts}}`.

**Consumes:** the generated stubs; `TokenSource` from `@loams/client` (D608) if exported, else a local interface with the same shape.

**Produces** (R1 Task 14's API, extended):

```ts
export class LiveClient {
  constructor(opts: { baseUrl: string; app?: string; auth?: TokenSource; transport?: "connect" | "grpc-web"; fetch?: typeof fetch });
  watch<T = LiveValue>(fn: string, args?: LiveValue): Subscription<T>;
  query<T = LiveValue>(fn: string, args?: LiveValue): Promise<T>;
  mutate<T = LiveValue>(fn: string, args?: LiveValue, opts?: { idempotencyKey?: string; optimistic?: (local: LocalStore) => void }): Promise<{ result: T; commitTs: bigint }>;
  paginate<T>(fn: string, args: LiveValue, opts: { numItems: number }): PaginatedSubscription<T>;
  setAuth(auth: TokenSource | null): Promise<void>;     // Authenticate on the open session
  close(): void;
}
```

Behaviour:
- reconnect with jitter (250 ms to 10 s);
- resume on a version gap, `session_rotate`, `node_draining` or `session_gone`;
- refresh and `Authenticate` before expiry, and on `token_expired` a refresh then a resume;
- the `loams-live-app` header;
- a UUIDv7 idempotency key once per logical mutation;
- `RetryInfo` honoured;
- lossless `int64`;
- no Node built-ins under `src/`.

**Tests:**
- `session.test.ts` (a fake transport): `applies_transitions_in_version_order`, `resumes_on_version_gap`, `drops_optimistic_update_at_commit_ts`, `resumes_on_session_rotate_and_draining`, `identity_change_discards_old_results`.
- `auth.test.ts`: `authenticates_before_expiry`, `token_expired_refreshes_and_resumes`.
- `values.test.ts`: `int64_roundtrip_is_lossless`.
- `live.test.ts` (against `loams dev`, embedded): `watch_sees_insert_from_another_client`, `mutate_returns_commit_ts_and_watch_catches_up`, `reconnect_after_server_restart_converges`, `paginate_walks_all_pages`.

**Commit:** `sdk: the Loams Live reactive TypeScript client`.

### Task 35: Session conformance fixtures

**Files:** `sdks/fixtures/live/*.json`, `sdks/fixtures/manifest.json`, `crates/loams-live/tests/fixtures.rs`, `sdks/typescript/packages/live/test/fixtures.test.ts`.

**Consumes:** §44 §10.4's fixture runner conventions; Task 34.

**Produces:** fixtures for:
- initial set, add and remove;
- a gap and its resume;
- chunked Transitions (`more`);
- merged Transitions under backpressure;
- an identity change;
- rotate, draining and gone;
- `token_expired`;
- a quota error with `RetryInfo`.

Each fixture is replayed against the real server (Rust) and through the client's fake transport (TypeScript).

**Tests:** `every_live_fixture_passes_on_server`, `every_live_fixture_passes_in_client`, and `results/typescript-live.json` written (generated, not committed, D640).

**Commit:** `sdk: Live session conformance fixtures`.

### Task 36: `@loams/live-react`

**Files:** `sdks/typescript/packages/live-react/{package.json,src/{index.ts,provider.tsx,hooks.ts},test/hooks.test.tsx}`.

**Consumes:** Task 34.

**Produces:** `LiveProvider`, `useQuery(fn, args | "skip")`, `useMutation(fn)` with `.withOptimisticUpdate(...)`, `usePaginatedQuery(fn, args, { initialNumItems })` with `loadMore`, and `useLiveAuth()`, built on `useSyncExternalStore`. React 19 is a peer dependency.

**Tests:**
- `use_query_renders_and_updates`;
- `skip_does_not_subscribe`;
- `unmount_unsubscribes`;
- `optimistic_update_renders_then_reconciles`;
- `paginated_load_more_appends`;
- `strict_mode_double_mount_subscribes_once`.

**Commit:** `sdk: React hooks for Loams Live`.

### Task 37: `@loams/live-cli` and `loams live deploy`

**Files:** `sdks/typescript/packages/live-cli/{package.json,src/{cli.ts,bundle.ts,deploy.ts,codegen.ts,migrate.ts,logs.ts},test/*.test.ts}`, `crates/loams/src/main.rs` (`live deploy --bundle --schema`).

**Consumes:** `LiveAdminService`; esbuild.

**Produces:**
- `npx loams-live init | dev | deploy | deployments | rollback [--to <id>] | logs [--follow] | migrate run <fn> | codegen`;
- `dev` watches `loams/`, bundles, and deploys to the dev app with `expected_active`;
- `codegen` writes `loams/_generated/api.ts` (typed function references from the export metadata and argument validators);
- the Rust `loams live deploy --bundle <file.js> --schema <schema.json> [--app] [--message]` for CI without Node.

**Tests:**
- `bundle_produces_single_esm_module`;
- `deploy_sends_expected_active_and_reports_conflict`;
- `rollback_lists_and_activates`;
- `migrate_runs_batches_until_done_and_resumes_with_cursor`;
- `codegen_types_match_validators` (a `tsc` compile of a sample);
- the Rust `live_deploy_cli_roundtrip`.

**Commit:** `sdk: the Loams Live CLI`; `cli: loams live deploy`.

### Task 38: Documentation

**Files:** `docs/guides/live/{quickstart,functions,schema,auth,deploy,operations,backup,limits}.md`, `docs/design/20-reactive-database-on-tikv.md` (as built), `docs/design/45-loams-live-production.md` (as built), `docs/plans/2026-09-27-r1-reactive-core.md` (the status of Tasks 13, 14, 16 and 17: "done in LV1"), `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Produces:** §45 §17's list. Every command in the guides is run by a doc test (`scripts/docs/check-live-guides.sh` runs the quickstart against `loams dev` in CI).

**Tests:** `live_quickstart_runs` (CI); `limits_page_generated` (from Task 28); link check.

**Commit:** `docs: Loams Live developer and operator guides`.

### Task 39: Security review and fuzzing

**Files:** `docs/security/live-threat-model.md`, `crates/loams-live/fuzz/` (cargo-fuzz targets), `crates/loams-live-js/fuzz/`, `.github/workflows/live-nightly.yml`.

**Consumes:** §45 §16.

**Produces:**
- the threat model covering every §45 §16 item, each mapped to its mitigation and to the test that proves it (or marked as an accepted risk with the owner);
- fuzz targets `value_decode`, `tuple_decode`, `cursor_decode`, `worker_frame`, `jwt_parse`, `api_key_parse`, run nightly for 10 minutes each;
- `cargo deny check` clean;
- the external review scheduled (Q635, an owner action).

**Tests:** `fuzz_targets_build`; the nightly fuzz job; `threat_model_items_have_tests` (a script checks that every row names a test that exists).

**Commit:** `docs: the Loams Live threat model`; `live: fuzz targets for Live decoders`.

### Task 40: Stabilize the protocol, the exit report and the release gate

**Files:** `proto/loams/live/v1/*.proto` (drop `unstable`), `buf.yaml` (stop excluding the package from `buf breaking`), `crates/loams/src/api/connect.rs` (`unstable: false` when the gate passes), `docs/plans/lv1-exit-report.md`, `docs/plans/README.md`, this plan's status.

**Consumes:** every earlier task.

**Produces:**
- the exit report: every checklist row below with its evidence (CI run links, the bench JSON, the restore drill log, the nemesis report, the review summary);
- the gate decision. If every row passes, `loams.live.v1` is stable and `GetInstance` reports `unstable: false`. Otherwise Live ships labelled preview (D698), and the report lists the failing rows.

**Tests:** `buf_breaking_covers_live` (CI); `get_instance_live_not_unstable` (only when the gate passed).

**Commit:** `live: stabilize loams.live.v1`; `docs: LV1 exit report`.

## Self-review

- Every §45 section maps to tasks:

  | §45 | Tasks |
  |---|---|
  | §3 | 3–7, 10 |
  | §4 | 8–9, 37 |
  | §5 | 14–17 |
  | §6 | 12, 18 |
  | §7 | 13 |

  | §15 | 33 |
  | §16 | 39 |
  | §17 | 38 |
  | §18 | 40 |

- R1's unbuilt tasks:

  | R1 task | LV1 tasks |
  |---|---|
  | 13 | 3–7 |
  | 14 | 34 |
  | 16 | 1, 2, 25 |
  | 17 | 38 |

- Every task names its tests, and each test states what it asserts.
- External dependencies:
  - `loams-auth` (Task 14 builds the core if absent);
  - the `Authorizer` (Task 15 has an interim);
  - main-port TLS (Task 18 builds it if absent);
  - the metrics registry (Task 27 builds it if absent);
  - the reference rig (Task 33, an owner action).
- No task edits `apps/desktop-electron/` or `web/`.

## Exit criteria for production

Live is labelled **production** in a release only when every box is checked on the release candidate (D698). Otherwise it ships as **preview**.

**Correctness**
- [ ] `kv_conformance!` passes on embedded and TiKV.
- [ ] The reactive checker passes on both backends with every disturbance: deploy, rollback, index add and drop, identity change, node kill.
- [ ] The transaction checker passes. Point-read promotion shows no write skew. The range write-skew behaviour is documented (Q31).
- [ ] The Live mutation fault matrix passes. No acknowledged mutation is lost, and no idempotent mutation is applied twice.
- [ ] The nemesis ran **24 hours green** on the HA topology for this release.
- [ ] `missed_invalidation_total` stayed at 0 throughout the nemesis and the benchmarks.

**Functions and schema**
- [ ] Deploy, rollback, dry run and deploy conflicts work over `LiveAdminService` and `@loams/live-cli`.
- [ ] Validators are enforced. Tightening scans and fails safely.
- [ ] Online index add and drop work on a 1 M-document table under load (P11).
- [ ] Multi-tenant mode refuses to start without `isolated`. The sandbox tests pass on Linux.

**Security and exposure**
- [ ] Live is served on the main port. Non-loopback requires TLS and auth.
- [ ] `authz_matrix` is blessed and reviewed. The tenant fence (`live_app_mismatch`) is tested.
- [ ] End-user OIDC works with Zitadel (e2e) and with a generic issuer.
- [ ] Session expiry, revocation and rotation are tested. Results are never shared across identities.
- [ ] No canary appears in logs, spans or metrics. No raw keys appear in errors.
- [ ] The threat model is complete. The fuzz targets have run nightly for 14 days with no open crash.
- [ ] The external review is done with no open high or critical finding (Q635).

**Operations**
- [ ] The reference HA topology passes its compose smoke test. Draining works.
- [ ] Metrics, traces, logs and alert rules are shipped and validated.
- [ ] Every quota has an at-limit and a past-limit test, and the limits page is generated.
- [ ] Every app's backup export is running, with lag ≤ 15 s at P2 load (P12).
- [ ] The restore drill passed on this release candidate (TiKV), including PITR to a middle tick.
- [ ] The cluster DR path is documented (BR, if the spike is positive).
- [ ] `gc_blocked_seconds` is exported and alerting.

**Performance**
- [ ] P1–P15 are measured on the reference rig and recorded in the exit report. None regressed past its threshold, and the owner has confirmed the baselines (Q633).

**Developer experience**
- [ ] `loams dev` and Loams Desktop run Live with no TiKV (embedded default).
- [ ] `@loams/live`, `@loams/live-react` and `@loams/live-cli` are published at 1.0 and pass 100% of the Live fixtures.
- [ ] The guides are published and the quickstart doc test is green.

**Contract**
- [ ] `loams.live.v1` has `unstable` dropped, `buf breaking` covers it, and `GetInstance` reports `unstable: false`.
- [ ] Every Live error reason is registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`.

## Rulings made during execution

Task 0 (reconciliation against `dev` at 6079e4d7, 2026-10-08).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0-1 | **R1 Tasks 13, 14, 16, 17 are unbuilt, as the plan assumed.** `crates/loams-live/src/deploy.rs` exports `DEPLOY_UNIMPLEMENTED` and `Deploy` answers `UNIMPLEMENTED` (its header says Task 13 follows). There is no `loams-live-js` crate and no `loams-auth` crate. `sdks/typescript/packages/live` holds only `src/{gen,index.ts}`, generated code with no hand-written client. `crates/loams-live/src` has no `js`, `auth` or `admin` module. | Directory listings and `deploy.rs` | None |
| T0-2 | **AP1e Task 20 (`_system:tables`) has merged.** `crates/loams-live/src/system.rs` defines `TABLES = "_system:tables"`, a query with args `{}` returning `[{ name, id, indexes: [{ name, fields }] }]`, built-ins included, with a unit test. Task 12 adds nothing; it only keeps `_system:tables` in the "internal, never public" set (§45 §3.4) and in the admin-only function list. | `system.rs` lines 10, 32 and 159 | None |
| T0-3 | **`loams-auth` does not exist** (no `Verifier`, no `KeyStore`, no `jsonwebtoken` or `openidconnect` in the workspace). Task 14 builds the verification core with the interfaces its text gives and records the as-built surface here when done. MT1 Task 2 has not landed on `dev`. LV1b's order stays as planned, with Task 14 free of MT1. | `ls crates`, `Cargo.toml` | If MT1 lands first, Task 14 reuses its crate and this ruling is superseded |
| T0-4 | **The engine has no metrics registry, admin listener or OTLP export.** Only `loams-qdrant` routes `GET /metrics` (a compatibility stub). `crates/loams/Cargo.toml` has no prometheus or opentelemetry dependency. Tasks 27 and 28 add the minimum: `prometheus-client` and the admin listener in 27, OTLP in 28. Live's only counters today are the subscription counters exposed through the server handle (`missed_invalidations`). | grep of the workspace | Task 27 grows if M2's observability lands first |
| T0-5 | **The main port has no TLS and no auth layer.** `crates/loams/src` has no rustls use and no bearer handling; `rustls` is only a workspace pin with `default-features = false`. MT1 Task 7 is not merged, so Task 18 adds `[tls] cert_file, key_file, client_ca?` itself, gated exactly as MT1 Task 7 specifies (non-loopback requires TLS and auth). | `crates/loams/Cargo.toml`, `crates/loams/src` | None |
| T0-6 | **Naming drift, to fix in Task 23.** (a) Doc comments and log lines say "Loam Live" (`service.rs` lines 1, 33, 120; `main.rs` 636, 640, 648, 658; `server.rs` 270, 353, 460, 462, 637, 682, 709, 727, 1038, 1927, 1933, 1940; `Cargo.toml` 91). (b) `--live-keyspace` help says `loam_live_<app>`; the constant `KEYSPACE_PREFIX` is `loams_live_`. (c) The doc comments of `service.rs` say the package is `loam.live.v1`; the proto package and the wire path are `loams.live.v1`. The wire is correct; only text changes. | Greps | Cosmetic; a user-facing error message would be wrong |
| T0-7 | **Consumed surface is as built.** `LiveArgs` has exactly `--live-listen` (default `127.0.0.1:7710`, loopback-only check at startup), `--live-pd` (default `127.0.0.1:19379`), `--live-keyspace`, `--live-app` (default `dev`), `--live-tick-read-lag-ms` (default 50) and `--no-live`. `LiveAbsent` and `CATALOGUE` are in `crates/loams/src/api/connect.rs`; the `loams.live.v1` row is currently `available: false`-style via `LiveAbsent` and `unstable` is a field of the row. `Runner::try_quiesce` exists at `txn.rs:672` (returns `Option<Quiesced>`, with a test at `tests/txn.rs:1404`) and Task 9 retires it as planned. `loams-tikv` modules present: `classify, codec, config, faults, gc, keyspace, pd, regions, runner, testing, token, tso, txn`. | Reading | None |
| T0-8 | **Dependency versions and licences.** `rquickjs` 0.14.0 (MIT, MSRV 1.87), `seccompiler` 0.5.0 (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause), `landlock` 0.4.7 (MIT OR Apache-2.0), `prometheus-client` 0.25.1 (Apache-2.0 OR MIT), `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-otlp` 0.33.0 (Apache-2.0). All are allowed by the licence policy as far as the plan's list goes (check `deny.toml` in Task 23). The Tech Stack licence for `seccompiler` is corrected to "Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause". A throwaway crate with the three sandbox and JS dependencies, with the Task 21 feature set for `rquickjs`, **resolved** with a lockfile of 40 packages on Rust 1.97.1. It was **not compiled**, to keep the shared target dir cold; Task 21's first step compiles it. | `cargo info`, `cargo generate-lockfile` | A compile failure (for example `rquickjs-sys` needing a C toolchain) shows in Task 21 |
| T0-9 | **Owner answers to Q625, Q626, Q629, Q631, Q639: none given.** The §45 defaults stand: Q625 actions and scheduled functions stay in R2; Q626 embedded is dev and Desktop only; Q629 `live-tikv` is binary-only; Q631 function code only, no declarative rules; Q639 a Live app is 1:1 with an environment. | Plan and spec text carry no answers | Any later answer reopens the affected task |
| T0-10 | **Desktop contract: Live has its own port today.** `apps/desktop-electron` (not edited here) reserves a fifth port (`ports.live`) and starts the engine with `--live-listen 127.0.0.1:<live> --live-pd <pd>`, or `--no-live` when the binary lacks the flag (`engine/binary.ts`: `helpSupportsLive` matches `--no-live` or `--live-listen`). The supervisor sets `liveUrl = http://127.0.0.1:<live>`. The protocol handler (`protocol/route.ts`) forwards `/loams.live.v1.*` from `loams-app://console` to `engine.liveUrl`, and the agent tools (`agent-tools/live.ts`) post Connect JSON to `<liveUrl>/loams.live.v1.LiveService/{Query,Mutate}` with no `Authorization` header. | Reading the desktop code | See T0-11 to T0-13 |
| T0-11 | **Main-port move is non-breaking for the desktop if `--live-listen` keeps working** (Task 12 already keeps it, deprecated, loopback only, same services; D688). The deprecation line is printed to the engine log, which the desktop captures but does not parse. **Follow-up for the desktop owner** (not in LV1): drop the fifth port and `--live-listen`, set `liveUrl` to the main `http` URL, and make `helpSupportsLive` accept the new flag set. Until `--live-listen` is removed in a later release, LV1 must not remove it. The removal needs a release note. | Keeps AP1e working while LV1 lands | None if the flag stays |
| T0-12 | **Auth on loopback must stay off by default.** The desktop sends no credentials and runs on loopback. Task 15's rule is therefore the one in §45 §6: loopback listeners with no `[auth]` config accept unauthenticated requests (dev mode, one warning in the log); non-loopback requires TLS and auth. Task 15 must not make auth mandatory for loopback. **Follow-up for the desktop owner:** none now; once `[auth]` is configured on a Desktop-run engine, the protocol handler must add `Authorization: Bearer`. | Desktop sends no credentials | The Live page and agent tools fail with 401 if auth is forced |
| T0-13 | **Value JSON and function-name contract the desktop relies on.** (a) Proto3 JSON of `loams.live.v1.Value` (`nullValue`, `boolValue`, `int64Value` as a decimal string, `doubleValue`, `stringValue`, `bytesValue` as base64, `arrayValue.values`, `objectValue.fields`), plus the desktop-side forms `{"$int64":"<decimal>"}` and `{"$bytes":"<base64>"}` shared with the Live page. These are client-side conventions, not wire changes. (b) `Query` and `Mutate` request and response field names, including the response `result` and `ts` (or `commitTs`). (c) `_system:tables` (T0-2) and the other `_system:*` read functions the Live page calls. **LV1 must keep all of these byte-compatible.** Task 3 (`unstable` dropped) and the `ctx.auth`, `paginate` and public/internal changes of Tasks 15, 17 and 26 are additive. Rule for every task: `buf breaking` must stay green and no existing field number or JSON name changes. Public and internal functions (D699): an existing function with no declared visibility must default to **public**, so desktop-deployed apps and the agent tools keep working. **Follow-up for the desktop owner:** `_system:*` becomes admin-only on the end-user path (§45 §3.4); when auth is on, the Live page needs an admin credential. | Reading `agent-tools/live.ts`, `route.ts`, `supervisor.ts` | A visibility default of internal would break every deployed app |
| T0-14 | **Embedded store and the desktop stack.** `deploy/tikv/compose.yaml` runs PD and one TiKV (API v2, v8.5.0 image, host networking, PD on 19379 as the `--live-pd` default). LV1c's embedded default means the desktop no longer needs that stack to run Live. **Follow-up for the desktop owner:** when the embedded store is the default, `--live-pd` becomes optional and `wantLive` in the supervisor should no longer depend on `livePd`; keep the TiKV stack as an opt-in. Until then Task 25's flag set must keep `--live-pd` meaning "use TiKV" and an absent `--live-pd` meaning embedded, **but only after** Task 25 lands; the desktop passes `--no-live` when there is no PD, which stays valid. | Reading `supervisor.ts`, `compose.yaml` | The desktop keeps showing "Live needs a TiKV stack" until updated |
| T0-15 | **The plan's version of the engine's TiKV image and playground differ.** The compose file pins `v8.5.0` (overridable by `TIKV_TAG`); the plan's cluster tests use `tiup playground v8.5.8`. Not a conflict (different uses). Task 30's BR binary and the test cluster use 8.5.8; the desktop stack is not upgraded by LV1. | Compose file, plan Tech Stack | None |

Task 20 (the `loams-kv` seam, 2026-10-08).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T20-1 | **The tuple codec moved to a new leaf crate, `loams-tuple`**, not into `loams-kv`; `loams-kv` and `loams-tikv` both re-export it (`loams_kv::tuple`, `loams_tikv::{tuple, codec::tuple, CodecError}` keep their paths). `Ts` lives in `loams-kv` only and is not re-exported from `loams-tikv`. Amends Ruling 2. | `loams-kv`'s tikv backend depends on `loams-tikv`, so `loams-tikv` cannot re-export from `loams-kv` without a package cycle. `loams-tikv` and `loams-meta-tikv` use tikv-client's `Timestamp` and never need `Ts`. | One more crate in the workspace |
| T20-2 | **`loams-tikv` gains `Tikv::run_as::<W, T, E, F>` and the trait `RunTxn`** (additive; `Tikv::run` keeps its signature and calls `run_as::<Txn, _, TxnError, _>`). The body works on `W: RunTxn`, which owns the attempt's `Txn`, and fails with any `E: Into<TxnError>`. `loams_kv::Txn` implements `RunTxn`, so `Store::run` hands its body straight to the TiKV runner. | `loams_kv::Txn` has no lifetime parameter (the plan's `pub enum Txn`), so it must own the attempt's `loams_tikv::Txn`; converting the body's error by rewrapping its future would force `T: 'static` | None: retries, tokens, faults and error classes are `run`'s own code |
| T20-3 | **Features of `loams-kv`:** `tikv = ["dep:loams-tikv"]` and `faults = ["loams-tikv?/faults"]`. `Store::with_faults` exists only with `faults` (as `Tikv::with_faults` does). No `embedded` feature yet (Task 21 or 23 adds it if the embedded backend's dependencies must be optional). `loams-live` depends on `loams-kv` with `tikv` until Task 23; its dev-dependency adds `faults`. | Mirrors `loams-tikv`'s fault gating; keeps fault hooks out of release builds | Task 23 reshapes the feature list anyway |
| T20-4 | **The embedded stub is uninhabited**: `embedded::{Handle, Txn, Snap}` each hold a `std::convert::Infallible`, so every embedded match arm is statically unreachable (no panics). `Store::open(StoreConfig::Embedded(_))` returns `KvError::Unsupported("embedded backend arrives in Task 21")`. `testing::stores(name)` yields only the TiKV store until Task 21. `loams_kv::testing` also re-exports `loams_tikv::testing`'s cluster harness (`cluster`, `TestCluster`, `TEST_LIVE`, …) and adds `testing::tikv()` (a TiKV store on `TEST_LIVE` under a fresh root), so `loams-live`'s tests need no `loams-tikv` dependency. | No placeholder behaviour to remove later; Task 21 replaces the three types | None |
| T20-5 | **`LiveConfig.tikv: TikvConfig` stays** (re-exported as `loams_kv::TikvConfig`); Task 21 replaces it with `store: StoreConfig` (T20-9; Task 23 in the original plan). `LiveServer::start` opens `Store::open(StoreConfig::Tikv(config.tikv))`. `Runner::tikv()` and `LiveHandle::tikv()` became `store()`. `crates/loams/src/server.rs` (outside the task's file list) reaches the TiKV handle for its cluster GC loop and sweep list through the new `Store::as_tikv() -> Option<&Tikv>` (feature `tikv`); an embedded store needs no cluster GC. | Keeps `crates/loams/src/main.rs`, `crates/loams/tests/live.rs` and the CLI unchanged until Task 23 | None |
| T20-6 | **`Store::barrier(name, at, ttl)` uses the service id `loams/<name>`**, `name` being `<purpose>/<id>`. `loams_kv::GcBarrier` has `service_id()`, `ts()` and `delete(self)`. | `loams_tikv::GcBarrier` requires the `loams/` prefix; one name argument as the plan's signature has | None until Task 29 uses it |
| T20-7 | **`Ts` extras:** `Ts::logical()`, `Display` (the decimal version) and `Default`; `from_parts` masks `logical` to 18 bits. tikv-client converts versions through `i64`, so `Ts` and `Timestamp` agree for physical parts below 2^45 ms (year 3084). `Snap::ts()` returns `Ts` by value. `KvError` is `Unsupported(&'static str)` or `Tikv(TikvError)` with the TiKV text unchanged (`#[error(transparent)]`), so Live's error messages are byte-identical. | Needed by `lagged` and its test; keeps error texts stable | None |
| T20-8 | **Test environment:** the machine's test cluster runs at another port offset than the plan's 17000, so `loams-tikv`'s `gc::safe_point_advances_cluster_wide` needs `LOAMS_TEST_TIKV_STATUS=127.0.0.1:20280` beside `LOAMS_TEST_PD=127.0.0.1:23790`. Not a code change. | It reads TiKV's status port, default `127.0.0.1:37180` | None |
| T20-9 | **`LiveConfig.store: StoreConfig` (replacing `LiveConfig.tikv`) and a `LiveServer` that starts on any `Store` move from Task 23 into Task 21** (controller ruling, review of Task 20). Task 21's and Task 23's file lists are amended; Task 23 keeps the CLI flag, the feature split and the embedded default. Not implemented in Task 20. | Task 22 can then run the `service` and `session` suites, which start a `LiveServer`, on the embedded backend | Task 21 grows by the config change and its callers in `crates/loams` |

Task 21 (the embedded MVCC backend on redb, and T20-9, 2026-10-08).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T21-1 | **The `versions` key escapes the key: `keyspace_id:u32 BE ‖ esc(root ‖ key) ‖ (u64::MAX − commit_ts) BE`.** `esc` writes each `0x00` as `0x00 0xFF` and ends with `0x00 0x00`. Values are as Ruling 4 says (`0x00 ‖ value`, or `0x01` for a tombstone). Amends Ruling 4's layout. | Raw `root ‖ key ‖ ts` is not prefix-free. Key `a`'s versions sort among the versions of `a\x00…`, and a scan bounded by `a\x05` misses `a`, whose versions sort above the bound. Escaping keeps key order, makes each key's versions contiguous (newest first), and maps a key range to exactly one table range. | About 2 bytes more per version |
| T21-2 | **The oracle persists its high-water mark 1 s ahead.** Every timestamp issued is below the persisted `oracle.high_water`. Before one would reach the mark, the mark moves to the timestamp's millisecond + 1 000 and is persisted (by the committer inside the group's own write transaction, or by a blocking write). Under steady use that is about one write a second, and 2^18 logical values per millisecond far exceed "1 000 allocations". A restart starts above the mark. A `snapshot(at)` above every issued timestamp moves the oracle past `at` and persists a mark above it (TiKV's `max_ts`), so no later commit lands at or below a read already taken. | Reserving ahead is crash-safe. A lagging mark ("persist every 1 000 allocations") could reissue timestamps after a crash. | One extra write transaction per second of activity |
| T21-3 | **The `oracle` table also holds `gc_safe_point`.** GC persists it in the same write transaction that drops the versions, and it never moves back. Snapshots, transactions and barriers below it are refused after a restart too. | Otherwise a restart would forget how far GC went, and a new barrier could let a snapshot read versions that are already gone | None |
| T21-4 | **`EmbeddedConfig` changes:** it gains `gc_interval` (default 60 s; the first handle on a file sets it) and `EmbeddedConfig::new(path, keyspace)` (empty root, `gc_life_time` 10 min, `gc_interval` 60 s). `gc_life_time` must exceed one minute, `gc_interval` must be positive and the keyspace must be non-empty. Reads have TiKV's window, `gc_life_time − 1 min`. Past it, a `snapshot(at)` is refused with `KvError::GcSafePoint` and an open `Snap`'s reads with `Fatal("read below the GC safe point")`, unless a barrier covers `at`. Any read below the persisted GC safe point is refused. | Parity with TiKV's window (row R7) and its config check. The conformance barrier case runs unchanged on both backends. | None |
| T21-5 | **`KvError` gains three variants and loses one.** New: `Embedded(String)`, plus `GcSafePoint { at, safe_point }` and `BarrierBelowSafePoint { service_id, ts, min_safe_point }` with the TiKV texts unchanged. `Unsupported` is removed, since the stub is gone and nothing constructed it. | Live's error texts stay the same on both backends | Code that matches `KvError::Tikv(GcSafePoint)` must also match the embedded variant (the conformance helper does) |
| T21-6 | **There is one database per file per process.** A registry keyed by the canonical path gives every `Handle` on a file the same redb `Database`, oracle, committer thread and GC thread, and the file closes with the last handle. A reopen waits up to 2 s for this process's previous handle to close the file. Another process holding the file gets `KvError::Embedded("the store file … is open in another process")`. `embedded::is_open(path)` is public. Barriers and open snapshots are per file, across keyspaces (as PD's service safe points are cluster-wide). The file's GC life time is the longest any handle asked for. Keyspace ids are assigned from 1 on first use. | redb locks its file (Task 20 review) | None |
| T21-7 | **Embedded transaction semantics follow `tikv-client`'s buffer.** Reads are cached. An `insert` of a key the transaction read as present fails at once; any other insert fails at commit. An insert-then-delete leaves a not-exists check. `lock_keys` is a lock-only mutation. The committer checks conflicts before inserts. Its checks: a written or locked key has a version newer than the start timestamp (or than its pessimistic lock), or a pessimistic lock of another transaction holds it, giving `Conflict`; an inserted key is present, giving `AlreadyExists("key already exists: \"…\"")`. A read-only transaction commits at its start timestamp. A failed write transaction is `Undetermined`, which the runner resolves through the commit token. The backend's raw API is public: `Handle::begin(mode)`, `embedded::Txn::commit()` and `Handle::{snapshot, now, barrier, gc_once, gc_once_at, stats}`. The model check uses it, and later checkers can too. | The seam's behaviour must not depend on the backend (Review Focus 4). The runner's retries would hide interleavings from the model check. | None |
| T21-8 | **(Superseded by T21-15.)** **Pessimistic mode on embedded uses an in-process lock table.** `put`, `insert`, `delete` and `lock_keys` lock at once, wait up to 1 s for another holder, and then fail with `Conflict` (TiKV's lock wait and deadlock both map to `Conflict`). The lock timestamp is the key's conflict threshold. Reads stay at the start timestamp, as on TiKV, since the seam has no `get_for_update`, so a pessimistic read-modify-write can lose an update on either backend. The test `pessimistic_writers_queue` asserts only that writers queue. | Parity; `loams-live` does not use pessimistic mode today | A future pessimistic caller needs `get_for_update` on the seam |
| T21-9 | **Embedded GC also sweeps expired commit tokens and fences** under every root opened on the file, as one transaction per root. When the newest version at or below the safe point is a tombstone, GC drops it along with everything older. | The embedded store has no cluster GC loop to sweep tokens | None |
| T21-10 | **The conformance harness.** `kv_conformance!(backend, factory)` expands 13 `#[tokio::test]` cases (multi-thread) for a `testing::Factory`, which yields a store per `testing::Spec { root, gc_life_time }` or `None` to skip. The 13 cases are: the brief's six; `read_only_commit_is_at_start_ts`; four runner cases (retry on `Conflict`/`NotApplied`, `max_attempts`, no retry of `Fatal`/`AlreadyExists`, deadline); `fault_points_and_commit_tokens` (Task 20's fault table, moved here); and `barrier_holds_old_snapshots_and_refuses_below_safe_point` (Task 20's barrier test, moved here). `tikv_store_roundtrip` stays TiKV-only. `testing` gains `embedded()`, `embedded_factory(dir)`, `tikv_factory()`, `TempDir`, `TMPDIR_ENV` and its own `random_root`, which is no longer re-exported from `loams_tikv` but behaves the same. `stores()` now yields the embedded store first. Embedded test stores live under `LOAMS_TEST_TMPDIR` (default: the system temporary directory). `loams-kv`'s own tests use `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`. | The Task 20 review asked for runner-level cases held by both runners | None |
| T21-11 | **There is no `embedded` cargo feature yet.** `redb` is a plain dependency of `loams-kv`, so T20-3 stands. Task 23 decides whether `live = [..., "loams-kv/embedded"]` gates it. | The plan's Architecture says embedded is always built | Task 23 adds the feature if the binary split needs it |
| T21-12 | **Reads run inline in the async methods.** They are short redb read transactions served from redb's cache. Commits and fsyncs run on the committer thread; oracle marks and GC run on blocking threads. A commit group is capped at 1 024 transactions. | Avoids a thread hop per read | A very large scan blocks a runtime worker for its duration |
| T21-13 | **T20-9 as built.** `LiveConfig.store: StoreConfig` and `LiveConfig::with_store` exist; `with_tikv` wraps `StoreConfig::Tikv`, and `LiveConfig::new` still builds TiKV until Task 23. `loams-live` re-exports `StoreConfig` and `EmbeddedConfig`. `LiveServer::start` opens whatever store the config names. Its error text is now "opening the Live store (keyspace …)" instead of "connecting to the Live keyspace …". `crates/loams` checks "same cluster" only for a TiKV store and sweeps only TiKV handles. `Server::live_swept_by_metastore_gc()` is `false` on an embedded store, which runs its own GC. | Ruling T20-9 | None |
| T21-14 | **Fix round 1: a read timestamp may run at most 1 s ahead of the embedded store's clock.** `Store::snapshot(at)` on embedded refuses `at` above `max(last issued, wall clock) + 1 s` with the new `KvError::TsAhead { at, limit }`, before it moves the oracle or persists a mark. `Ts::from_parts` saturates (no wrap) above `Ts::MAX_PHYSICAL_MS`, and `Ts::checked_from_parts` is new; the oracle's mark arithmetic is checked. Task 19 validates `QueryRequest.ts` at the service edge on both backends. | `QueryRequest.ts` reaches `Store::snapshot`: a client could push the persisted mark to `u64::MAX` and wedge the oracle | A caller that reads at a timestamp it got from another, faster clock more than 1 s ahead is refused |
| T21-15 | **Fix round 1: `Store::run` refuses `Mode::Pessimistic` on both backends** with `TxnError::Fatal(PESSIMISTIC_REFUSED)` before the body runs. The conformance case `pessimistic_mode_is_refused` holds both backends to it. The embedded lock table is removed, and `embedded::Handle::begin()` takes no mode. Supersedes T21-8. | Nothing uses pessimistic mode. Reads stay at the start timestamp, and the seam has no `get_for_update`, so a pessimistic read-modify-write could lose an update on either backend. | The first pessimistic caller adds `get_for_update` to the seam (TiKV: `loams_tikv::Txn::get_for_update`; embedded: a lock table again) |
| T21-16 | **Fix round 1: GC counts only open reads inside the read window, and never passes the oracle.** An open snapshot or transaction older than `now − (gc_life_time − 1 min)` no longer holds GC: it cannot read any more, and a barrier that covers it is counted on its own. The candidate safe point is capped at the last timestamp issued. `gc_once_at` is `#[doc(hidden)]` and test-only. Embedded `Snap` and `Txn` reads refuse a timestamp GC has passed, with `Fatal("read below the GC safe point")`, instead of answering from what is left. Since the read floor is a minute above `now − gc_life_time`, the open-read term now never lowers the safe point by itself. It stays as the plan's formula, and as a guard should the window change. | A leaked `Snap` pinned GC forever. A GC run ahead of the clock refused every read at the clock. | None |
| T21-17 | **Fix round 1: the registry keys an existing file by its full canonical path**, so a symlinked file is the file it names. The registry also remembers each file's database (`Weak<Core>`) beside its handles. A reopen while this process's previous database is still closing waits up to 30 s for it, then fails with "the store file … is still closing in this process". A file locked when no database of this process is closing fails at once with "… is open in another process", instead of after a blind 2 s retry. | Two paths to one file tripped redb's file lock; a reopen racing the close reported another process | None |

Task 22 (parity suites on both backends, 2026-10-09).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T22-1 | **`live_test!` gives its body a `loams_live::testing::TestStore`, not a bare `Store`.** `TestStore` derefs to the `Store` and adds `store()`, `store_config()`, `live_config(app)`, `fresh_root()`, `backend()` and `dir()`. Besides `live_test!(name, \|store\| async { … })`, the shorthand `live_test!(name)` runs an `async fn name(store: TestStore)` in scope, so the migrated suites stay ordinary, rustfmt-formatted functions. The cases are `name::embedded` (always, on a fresh file under `LOAMS_TEST_TMPDIR`, else `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`) and `name::tikv` (with `LOAMS_TEST_PD`). Both run on a multi-thread runtime with 4 workers; some tests had used 2. | A service test starts a `LiveServer`, which opens its store from a `LiveConfig`, so the test needs the store's config as well as the store. A runner needs a `LiveConfig` for the same store. | None |
| T22-2 | **`every_live_suite_runs_on_embedded` reads the test sources rather than `--list`.** A `#[test]` or `#[tokio::test]` that reaches a store is a failure unless it is on the `TIKV_ONLY` allowlist with a reason. "Reaches a store" means a store marker such as `Runner::open`, `LiveServer::start` or `testing::cluster`, directly or through a local helper (followed to a fixed point). The meta-test also requires a `live_test!` case in each of `docs`, `journal`, `service`, `session`, `subs` and `txn`, and at least 60 `::embedded` cases (there are 64). The allowlist is empty: the TiKV-only behaviours the plan names (TSO-stream loss, region errors, a PD stall) are tested in `loams-tikv` and `loams-kv`, not in Live's suites. `value.rs` opens no store, so nothing moved. | Each test binary lists only its own tests, so `--list` from one binary cannot see the others. A probe test reaching a store two helpers deep fails the meta-test. | A store reached through a helper in another file, or through a macro, is not followed |
| T22-3 | **No parity gap: no change to the embedded backend.** Every existing Live test passes on embedded unchanged in its assertions. The changes are of form only. `server_runs_on_an_embedded_store` (Task 21) became `server_runs_on_the_configured_store`, on both backends. The `index_scan_order_matches_value_order` proptest runs its synchronous runner on `spawn_blocking`, driving each case on the test's runtime. `idempotent_mutate_applies_once_across_lost_ack` draws each case's root with `fresh_root()`. In `non_loopback_bind_is_refused`, the "starts" half uses the test's store. Locals named `tikv` were renamed `kv`. | The brief: fix gaps in the backend, never the test | None |
| T22-4 | **CI job `live-embedded`.** It runs `cargo test -p loams-kv -p loams-live --locked` with `LOAMS_TEST_PD` empty and `LOAMS_TEST_TMPDIR=$RUNNER_TEMP`. It runs on a pull request when the `live-embedded` filter matches, and always on pushes and the nightly. The filter is the brief's paths plus `crates/loams-tuple/**` (a dependency of `loams-kv`) and the toolchain anchor. The job is in the `CI required` summary. | The brief, plus the seam's own dependency | None |

Task 23 (`--live-store`, the feature split and dev defaults; with the Task 21 review prerequisites, 2026-10-09).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T21-18 | **Incremental embedded GC (Task 23 prerequisite).** A GC round scans the `versions` table in batches of at most 4 096 entries, one redb write transaction each. Between batches it keeps a resume cursor: the last entry scanned, and whether the current key already kept its newest version at or below the safe point. So a key's versions may span two batches, and commits interleave with the round. The doomed list never outgrows a batch. The first batch persists the safe point, before any deletion commits. `GcReport.batches` counts the write transactions. `Handle::tune_gc(batch, pause)` (feature `faults`) paces a round for tests. A round still runs to the end of the table; there is no cursor across rounds. | The Task 21 review: GC held the write lock for a whole-table scan and collected an unbounded list | A very large table takes many write transactions per round |
| T21-19 | **Embedded scans re-seek (Task 23 prerequisite).** Per key, a scan reads the key's first table entry in its direction, then the key's newest version at or below its timestamp (one point range), then seeks past every version of the key. So it reads about two entries per key, not one per version. A scan of more than 64 pairs runs on `spawn_blocking`; smaller ones stay inline (amends T21-12). `EmbeddedStats.scan_entries` counts the entries scans read. | The Task 21 review: a scan stepped through every version of every key | Two range lookups per key cost more than a step when a key has a single version |
| T23-1 | **Features as built.** In `crates/loams`, `live = ["dep:loams-live"]` is in `default`, and `live-tikv = ["live", "tikv", "loams-live/tikv"]`. `loams-live` gains a `tikv` feature (`["loams-kv/tikv"]`), and its normal dependency on `loams-kv` no longer enables TiKV. There is **no `loams-kv/embedded` feature**: the embedded store is always built into `loams-kv` (T21-11 stands), so the plan's `"loams-kv/embedded"` is dropped. There is no `full` variant package yet (CLI2, D286), so "`full` enables `live-tikv`" is recorded here for CLI2. `cargo tree -p loams -e normal` with default features has `loams-live` and no `tikv-client`; CI's `check` job asserts both. | `loams-live` is the crate the binary depends on for Live; a feature that turned nothing on would only mislead | CLI2 must add `live-tikv` to `full` |
| T23-2 | **`--live-store embedded \| tikv://<pd>[,<pd>][/<keyspace>]`.** The default is `embedded`, at `<data-dir>/live/store.redb` (`loams_live::store_path`), keyspace `loams_live_<app>`. A missing keyspace in the `tikv://` form defaults to `loams_live_<app>`. A build without `live-tikv` refuses `tikv://` at parse time with "--live-store tikv:// needs a build with the live-tikv feature". `--live-store` conflicts with `--live-pd`/`--live-keyspace`, and `--no-live` conflicts with every `--live-*` flag. `LiveConfig::new(data_dir, app)` is now the embedded default. The old TiKV constructor is `LiveConfig::on_tikv(pd, app)`, and both it and `with_tikv` need loams-live's `tikv` feature. | The brief | None |
| T23-3 | **The deprecated aliases in a `live-tikv` build.** `--live-pd` (no default any more) and `--live-keyspace` select TiKV, as `tikv://<pd>/<keyspace>`, and print `loams: warning: --live-pd and --live-keyspace are deprecated; use --live-store tikv://…` on stderr. `--live-keyspace` alone keeps the old PD default, 127.0.0.1:19379. | The brief: one release as aliases | None |
| T23-4 | **(Superseded by T23-7.)** **The deprecated aliases in a build without `live-tikv` (the desktop's).** `--live-pd` and `--live-keyspace` are **ignored with a warning**, and Live runs on the embedded store. The desktop builds `--features live,durable` and passes `--live-listen <port> --live-pd <pd>` when the user set a PD, so a hard error there would stop the desktop's engine from starting. Verified: a default build started with the desktop's exact flags serves Live on the embedded store under `<data-dir>/live/`. With no PD the desktop still passes `--no-live`, so Live stays off there until the desktop drops that flag. **Desktop follow-up** (not done here): drop the TiKV-gated `--no-live` (D692 amends D670), and build `live-tikv` if the desktop should keep a TiKV mode. | Keeps the desktop's engine starting (T0-11 to T0-14, coordinator instruction) | **Owner decision:** a user who set a PD on a `live`-only build gets embedded data, not TiKV data. The alternative is to fail fast. |
| T23-5 | **Live is on by default, so `loams dev` and `loams standalone` bind 127.0.0.1:7710.** Every test that spawns `loams dev` passes `--no-live` when the `live` feature is on: `it/http.rs`, `it/hot_http.rs`, `crash.rs`, `durable.rs`, and the `es` and `qdrant` harnesses. This follows their rule that parallel servers share no fixed port. The packaged binary (default features) now serves Live on loopback; `docs/release/packaging.md` says so. | A fixed port shared by parallel test servers fails them | A user whose port 7710 is taken must pass `--live-listen` or `--no-live` |
| T23-6 | **Naming (T0-6).** "Loam Live" is now "Loams Live", and `loam.live.v1` is now `loams.live.v1`, in `loams-live`'s service, `crates/loams`'s server, main, `Cargo.toml` and `--help`. The help no longer says `loam_live_<app>`. The `ServerError::Live` text is now "Loams Live: …". | Task 0 finding 6 | Log-scraping of the old text |
| T23-7 | **Fail fast: a build without `live-tikv` refuses `--live-pd` and `--live-keyspace`** at parsing, with "… need a build with the live-tikv feature …". It never gives a user local data when they asked for a cluster (controller ruling, supersedes T23-4). Every engine build that serves TiKV includes `live-tikv`. The desktop's engine builds (`fetch-engine.mjs`, `desktop-electron*.yml`, its README, `docs/release/desktop.md`) use `--features live,durable,live-tikv`. `crates/loams/Cargo.toml` has no feature bundle (no `full` or `standard` variant yet, CLI2), so `live-tikv` joins none. The desktop now drops `--no-live` for an engine whose `dev --help` lists `--live-store`, and gets embedded Live with no PD. With a PD it passes `--live-store tikv://<pd>` instead of the deprecated `--live-pd`. It keeps `--no-live` and `--live-pd` for older engines that lack `--live-store`. | Controller ruling | A `live`-only engine that a user points at a PD fails to start, with that message |
| | *Note (Task 23 review item 11):* this controller ruling overrides the Global Constraint "Do not edit `apps/desktop-electron/` or `web/`" for these files only: `apps/desktop-electron/{scripts/fetch-engine.mjs,README.md,src/main/engine/*,src/main/stacks/stacks.ts,src/main/settings.ts,src/main/index.ts,src/preload/index.ts,src/shared/contracts.ts,test/engine.test.ts,test/stacks.test.ts,test/e2e/smoke.spec.ts}`, the `desktop-electron*.yml` workflows, and (through T23-8) `web/plugins/{desktop-settings,live}` and `web/apps/console/src/cordis/fake-desktop.ts`. The AP1e owner is informed. | | |
| T23-8 | **The desktop never switches Live's store implicitly** (controller ruling; the AP1e owner is informed). **Setting:** a persisted desktop setting `live.store` in `settings.json`, either `embedded` (the default) or `tikv-stack`, set from Settings → Local stacks → Live. **Binding:** `bindLiveToTikv(stacks, engine, choice)` gives the engine the TiKV stack's PD only when the user chose `tikv-stack` *and* the stack runs; a running stack alone means nothing. **Chosen but down — "start on embedded":** if the user chose `tikv-stack` and the stack is down, the engine starts on its embedded store, and the engine state carries `liveNotice` = "Live on TiKV is unavailable; showing local data.", shown on the Live page and in Settings. **Choice:** starting embedded is picked over refusing Live, because the desktop's pages keep working on local data, and the notice says plainly which data they show. **Refresh:** a change of the choice re-applies at once (`refresh`), restarting the engine only when its store changes. **Types:** `LoamsDesktopApi.engine` gains `liveStore()` and `setLiveStore(choice)`, `EngineState.ready` gains `liveNotice?`, and the demo bridge (`fake-desktop.ts`) implements both. | A user's data must not move between stores because a container happened to be running | A user who wants TiKV must choose it once |
| T23-9 | **Telling `live-tikv` builds apart (Task 23 review item 1).** **Help text:** `--live-store`'s help names `tikv://` only in a `live-tikv` build, and `--live-pd`/`--live-keyspace` are hidden (and refused) elsewhere. **Probe:** the desktop reads the `--live-store` block of `dev --help` and reports `embedded` (embedded only) or `embedded+tikv`; an engine without `--live-store` is `tikv`. An `embedded` engine never gets a PD: Live runs embedded, with `liveNotice` = "This engine was built without Live on TiKV (the live-tikv feature); Live runs on local data." **Fallback:** if an engine still exits with the `live-tikv` refusal, the supervisor restarts it at once without the store flag, sets the same notice, and leaves the store flag out of later runs. That restart is not counted as a crash. A `/` in the keyspace of `--live-store tikv://` is refused. | The probe could not tell a `live` engine from a `live-tikv` one, so a PD reached an engine that refuses it | A help-text change in the engine must keep `tikv://` out of the `--live-store` block of non-`live-tikv` builds (tested by `live_store_help_names_tikv_only_with_live_tikv`) |

| T1-1 | **`Disturbance` gains two variants that are wired now.** `Disconnect { at_op }` disconnects every session (`Outbox::client_gone`) and resumes it from its last version (`Start::Resume`); `reactive_checker_resume_converges` uses it. `DropInvalidation { at_op }` arms `Subscriptions::drop_next_batch`; `reactive_checker_detects_missed_invalidation` uses it, so the checker is not vacuous. The variants the brief lists (`Deploy`, `Rollback`, `AddIndex`, `DropIndex`, `IdentityChange`, `NodeKill`) are reported as `ViolationKind::Unwired` violations naming the task that wires them (7, 9, 17 or 24), never skipped silently. `Report` gains `resumes`. `Violation` is `{ kind, session, detail }`, with the kinds `Stale`, `Late` (added in the Task 1 review, row T1-2), `VersionOrder`, `Gap`, `NotCaughtUp`, `SessionClosed`, `Unwired` and `Workload`. | The resume and non-vacuity tests need the workload to say when; the brief's struct has no other place for it | Tasks 7, 9, 17 and 24 replace an `Unwired` arm with real behaviour |
| T1-2 | **What is checked.** Every Transition is applied to a `ClientState`, and the client's *whole* state is recorded at its end. After the run, each recorded result is compared with `Runner::query` at the Transition's `end.ts`. Evaluations are shared between sessions watching the same query at the same tick. Checking the whole state, not only the updated queries, catches a missed invalidation that is never repaired: it leaves a stale result in the next Transition's state. **First tick (corrected in the Task 1 review; the whole-state check alone only shows a change arriving *eventually*):** the checker subscribes to the manager's `Tick` broadcast before any session opens and records each tick's `at` and arrival time. For consecutive Transitions of a session at `p` and `e`, no tick `T` with `p < T < e` may have a fresh result that differs from the state at `p` (a `Late` violation): the change at `T` was held back to a later tick. An Outbox merge, a lagged session's resubscribe and a resume legitimately skip ticks but deliver promptly, so a tick is checked only when `e` arrived more than `LATE_BOUND` (1 s) after it, counted from the re-sent Transition after a resume. The report counts, per session, the update-carrying Transitions that arrived before the writers finished; the seeded and resume tests require at least 3 per session, so a run whose sessions only catch up at the end fails. **Exceptions to strictly increasing versions:** a heartbeat (`start == end`, no updates), and the first Transition of a resumed session, which re-sends the full results at the client's last version. **Catch-up:** every session is told the last commit (`Sessions::mutation_committed`, as a client that made it would be), and must reach it within 30 s. **The subscription manager runs with its safety rerun off,** so a missed invalidation stays visible instead of being repaired. | The brief's four checks, made deterministic | A check over every Transition costs `transitions × queries` evaluations; a seed takes about 6 s on embedded |
| T1-3 | **The workload.** Tables `t0..tN`, each with an index `by_n` and 8 seeded documents. Each session holds 4 bounded queries: a range on `by_n` with limit 20, the top 5 of `by_n`, an equality with limit 20, a get of a seeded document, and the newest 10. **8 concurrent writers** take ops from a shared counter: about 50% inserts, 30% patches and 20% deletes, each writer deleting only documents it inserted and patching those and its share of the seeded documents (seeded document `i` belongs to writer `i mod 8`), so the `get` queries watch documents that change (Task 1 review). Each op carries the idempotency key `chk-{seed}-{writer}-{op}` (seeding inserts `chk-{seed}-seed-{table}-{i}`). A mutation that fails with a retryable storage error (`Deadline`, `Conflict`, `NotApplied`, `Undetermined`) is retried up to 5 times with the same key, as a client would: a try after one that committed without an answer is replayed (a success), so a retried delete does not fail with not-found (Task 1 review). The writers and queries draw from ChaCha8 streams; a seed reproduces the op mix, not the interleaving. A failing test writes `Report::dump` (the writers' op logs and every session's records) under `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`. Anything else is a `Workload` violation. | Under machine load, a single TiKV mutation sometimes passed its 10 s deadline, which is not a reactive failure | A latency problem in the runner shows only as retries, not as a violation |
| T1-4 | **Duration and CI sizes (revised in the Task 1 review).** `reactive_checker_passes_seeded_workload` reads its sizes from `LOAMS_CHECKER_SEEDS` and `LOAMS_CHECKER_OPS` (and the first seed from `LOAMS_CHECKER_SEED_OFFSET`); unset, it runs 10 seeds × 2 000 ops on embedded and 2 × 2 000 on TiKV. **Per PR:** `live-embedded` (and the workspace tests) run embedded at 10 × 2 000, about 60 s; the TiKV job runs 2 × 2 000 (about 1.5 min) with the other, short checker tests. **Nightly:** `tikv-nightly` runs TiKV at 10 × 2 000 from a seed offset of (days since the epoch × 10), so each night covers new seeds; the offset is printed by its own step and on failure, and a failing assertion names its seed and the command that reruns it alone. A seed reproduces the op mix (the queries and each writer's ops), not the interleaving of writers and ticks. | The brief's sizes cost about 8 min per TiKV run | A TiKV-only bug that needs many seeds shows a night late |


Task 2 (the transaction checker, 2026-10-09).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2-1 | **`loams-sim`'s simulation moves behind a default feature `sim`**; `elle` builds without it. Every dependency of `loams-sim` is optional and enabled by `sim`, and `tests/it` has `required-features = ["sim"]`. `loams-live` takes `loams-sim` as a dev-dependency by path with `default-features = false`, so its suites do not build the cluster (DataFusion, openraft, the object store). `cargo test -p loams-sim` is unchanged; `cargo test -p loams-sim --no-default-features --lib elle` runs the checker's own tests alone. | The brief puts the checker in `loams-sim`, whose default build is the whole simulation | A future `loams-sim` user that wants the simulation must keep the default features |
| T2-2 | **The checker's surface.** `loams_sim::elle::{History, Op, Mop, Outcome, Anomaly, AnomalyKind, Dep, Step, Edges, Analysis, analyze, check_list_append, check_serializable}`. **Snapshot isolation** is checked as Cerone and Gotsman characterise it (PODC 2016: `(ww ∪ wr) ; rw?` acyclic), so a dependency cycle is allowed only when two of its `rw` edges are adjacent. `check_list_append` fails on G0, G1a, G1b, G1c, G-single, **G-nonadjacent** (two or more `rw` edges, no two adjacent, the cycle read round; fix round 1), an incompatible order (two reads of a key, neither a prefix of the other: a lost append), an internal inconsistency (a transaction that does not see its own appends), a garbage read, a duplicated value and a value appended twice. G-nonadjacent is searched from each `rw` edge over (transaction, last edge was `rw`, `rw` count capped at 2) states, so the witness is a closed walk and may pass a transaction twice, which still breaks the characterisation. **G2** is reported only for a cycle with two adjacent `rw` edges (`Anomaly::has_adjacent_rw`): `analyze(..).g2()`, and `check_serializable` fails on it. An `Info` transaction counts as committed only when a read saw one of its values. There are no real-time or process edges, so it checks snapshot isolation, not strong snapshot isolation. | The brief's signature, with G2 apart because snapshot isolation allows it; the review asked for G-nonadjacent | A real-time anomaly (a stale read across clients) is not caught here; the reactive checker compares results against fresh snapshots instead |
| T2-3 | **The workload** (`tests/txn_checker.rs`). Keys are documents of the table `lists` with an array field `list`; a transaction is the test function `test:list_txn_{point,range}`, which reads a list by id (`db.get`) or by a scan of `by_creation_time`, and appends by reading the document by id and patching `list`; that read goes into the history as a read just before the append (fix round 1). Random runs: 8 clients, 10 keys, transactions of 1 to 4 micro-ops (half reads, half appends), client `c`'s mix from ChaCha8 at `seed × 1 000 + c`, idempotency key `txn-{seed}-{c}-{op}`, value `op × 8 + j + 1`, retryable storage errors tried up to 5 times with the same key (an exhausted one is `Info`), then one transaction that reads every key, which must commit (an unknown outcome there is an error, fix round 1), and every committed append must be in it. A seed reproduces each client's sequence of draws, not which op indices a client takes from the shared counter (so not its values or idempotency keys), not the interleaving, and not the runner's journal shard picks (the thread RNG in `Runner::mutate`; seeding them would not make a concurrent run replay). The `_system:*` functions only seed the lists and read outside transactions, since they run one operation per mutation. | A list-append transaction needs several reads and appends in one mutation | None |
| T2-4 | **Sizes.** `live_histories_are_snapshot_isolated` reads the reactive checker's variables (`LOAMS_CHECKER_SEEDS`, `LOAMS_CHECKER_OPS`, `LOAMS_CHECKER_SEED_OFFSET`) with its own defaults, `SizeDefaults::TXN`: 5 seeds on embedded, 2 on TiKV, 1 000 transactions each (`Sizes::from_env_or`). So CI's `live-embedded` job runs it at 10 × 2 000, the TiKV job at 2 × 2 000 and the nightly at 10 × 2 000 from the date's offset. Measured here: the four embedded cases in about 30 to 60 s, the four TiKV cases (2 × 1 000 for the random run) in about 3 min, one at a time. | One set of knobs for both checkers, as the brief asks | The CI jobs get slower by these amounts |
| T2-5 | **Non-vacuity.** Every random run (mixed, point-only, and range-only with `serializable_ranges`) must have `ww`, `wr` and `rw` edges, at least one transaction that reran on a conflict, and no committed append missing from the final read; a G2 in a mixed run must have adjacent `rw` edges. `txn_checker_flags_lost_appends` runs a control (real appends, passes) and a broken client whose appends write a list read outside the transaction (flagged, an incompatible order). The write-skew rounds force both sides to read before either writes (a barrier, first attempt only) on a journal of 1 024 shards; without `serializable_ranges` the checker must find G2 in 3 rounds, and with it, or with point reads, every round must have one side rerun and the history must be serializable. Observed: the mixed random runs show G2 on every seed (range reads), always with adjacent `rw` edges. **Range coverage:** a range read is a full scan of `by_creation_time`, and the workload neither inserts nor deletes after seeding, so phantoms (a range gaining or losing a document) are not exercised; only value changes inside the range are. | The brief's control-run and non-vacuity pattern | None |

Task 3 (`loams-live-js`, the QuickJS runtime, 2026-10-09).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T3-1 | **Dependencies.** `rquickjs` 0.14.0 (published 2026-09-18) with features `std`, `loader`, `array-buffer` and `properties`, not `futures` or `macro`: the runtime is driven synchronously on its own threads, and `properties` defines object fields (a field named `__proto__` stays a field). `relative-path` (pulled in by `loader`) is pinned to 2.0.1, since 2.0.2 is two days old (14-day rule); fix round 1 makes both pins explicit (`rquickjs = "=0.14.0"`, and `relative-path = "=2.0.1"` named by `loams-live-js` only to hold it, until 2026-10-21). `rquickjs-sys` builds at `opt-level = 2` in the dev profile, so the CPU-limit tests see interpreter speeds close to a release build. | Amends the Tech Stack's feature list (R1 row R13) | Task 5 or a later task adds `futures` if it wants an async runtime |
| T3-2 | **Slots, not one runtime per deployment.** A `Bundle` owns `contexts` slots (default 4). Each slot is an OS thread (8 MiB stack, QuickJS stack limit 1 MiB) with its own runtime, memory limit and interrupt handler, and it keeps one context ready (prelude run, globals frozen, bundle evaluated). A call takes the ready context, runs one invocation and drops it; the slot then prepares the next context before it takes another call, and runs the GC. After a timeout, an out-of-memory error, an aborted call or a call that left promise jobs queued, the slot replaces its whole runtime: a leftover job (a floating `async` loop) would otherwise run in the next call's `finish`, with that call's transaction, console and CPU (fix round 1, C1). The jobs the bundle's top level leaves run during preparation, within the load's CPU and memory limits, so none reaches the first call; a top level that never stops queueing jobs fails to load with `FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`. So the memory limit is per slot, up to `contexts × memory_limit` per bundle. `Bundle::load` evaluates the bundle once on a scratch thread to validate it, then starts the slots; it is `async` (fix round 1), so the caller awaits the evaluation instead of blocking its executor for up to `cpu_limit` (amends the brief's `fn load`). A slot that panics restarts after a backoff (10 ms, doubling, at most 5 s; reset after a minute without a panic), so a slot that panics at once never spins. Amends §20 §6.3's "one runtime per (node, app, deployment) with a pool of contexts". | A QuickJS runtime is single-threaded, and a host call blocks the slot until the store answers, so one runtime cannot serve concurrent calls. One context per invocation (R1 item 2a) holds. Task 5's worker can run the same slot loop | Memory per bundle is up to four times the per-runtime figure |
| T3-3 | **Host calls and CPU.** `ctx.db.*` calls `natives.host`, which sends the operation to the caller's future. The future runs it on the call's `LiveTxn` (the `_system:*` code paths, so reads land in the read set) and sends the answer back. The CPU meter counts the interpreter's time per call (wall time while JavaScript runs) and pauses during host calls; it is not thread CPU time, which needs `unsafe` or `libc` under `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. A storage error (`LiveError::Txn`) or a dropped caller aborts the call: the interrupt handler stops it uncatchably, and the caller returns the storage error, so the runner reruns a mutation. Any other host error is a catchable JavaScript `Error`; if it escapes the handler, the call fails with the host's own `LiveError` (for example `NOT_FOUND` for an unknown index). An `INTERNAL` or corrupt-data error reaches JavaScript as `internal error (the details are in the host's log)`: its detail (keys, paths, the store's text) is logged, never shown to the function (fix round 1). The caller still gets the full error. The bundle's top-level code has the same CPU and memory limits (errors name the function `<bundle>`). | A slow store must not time a function out; a conflict must never be swallowed by a `try` | On a loaded machine, wall time overstates CPU, so a call may be stopped early |
| T3-4 | **Bundle shape and surface.** Functions are the properties of exported objects: `export const messages = { send: mutation(…) }` is `messages:send`. A function exported at the top level is refused ("export functions inside a module object"), as are module names starting with `_` (reserved for `_system`) and names with `:`. Only `loams:server` can be imported. `args` is refused until Task 4 ("argument validators are not supported until LV1 Task 4"), so `Validator` is an empty enum and `FunctionMeta.args` is always `None`. `Bundle::load` enforces D682's 16 MiB (`max_bundle_bytes`) and 2 048 exports (`max_exports`), both `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`; other load failures are `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. `query`/`mutation` are public and `internalQuery`/`internalMutation` internal. `ctx.db` has R1's surface: `take(n)` is terminal and returns the array, as in Convex; a query's `ctx.db` has only `get` and `query`; `withIndex`'s field names are checked against the index's fields. `ctx.db.patch` refuses a field set to `undefined` with a `TypeError` naming `replace` (fix round 1): Convex removes such a field, R1 cannot (T8-9), and keeping it silently would surprise a Convex user. Values: `bigint` ↔ `I64` (out of range refused), number ↔ `F64`, `ArrayBuffer` ↔ `Bytes`, arrays and plain objects; an `undefined` field is left out; class instances, `Date`, typed arrays, proxies, functions and symbols are refused, and a value deeper than 64 levels (or cyclic) too. **Conversion budget (fix round 1, C2):** converting a JavaScript value charges 8 bytes per node (scalar, array slot, object field) plus the bytes of strings, keys and buffers, before allocating anything (an array's slots are charged from its `length`, read as a number since rquickjs's `Array::len` panics past 2^31; a string's UTF-16 length is charged before it is converted to UTF-8), and charges every reference to a shared value again. A result's budget is the new `Limits::max_result_bytes` (8 MiB, D682; over it is `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `limit max_result_bytes`); a `ctx.db` call's arguments get four times `Limits::max_document_bytes` (the charge is at most four times a value's encoded size, so every document the store accepts fits; over it is a catchable `max_document_bytes` error and the store is not called). The conversion checks the CPU meter every 1 024 nodes. `LiveTxn::limits()` hands the limits to the runtime. | A bundle has one module, so the module part of `module:export` needs a convention; refusing `args` never skips a validation silently | Task 36's bundler must emit module objects (esbuild's `import * as`) |
| T3-5 | **Determinism as built.** `Date`, `new Date()` and `Date.now()` give the call's start timestamp in ms; `Date.prototype.constructor` is the shim, so the original constructor is unreachable. `Math.random` is ChaCha8 seeded with SHA-256 of `"loams.live.random.v1\0" ‖ start_ts (u64 BE) ‖ request id`. The request id is a mutation's idempotency key (empty without one) and empty for queries through the `Runner`; `LiveTxn::{request_id, set_request_id}` carry it until Task 4's `CallCtx`. Module evaluation sees the clock at 0 and a fixed seed, so module-level values are the same in every context. `crypto` is a proxy whose every property throws `DeterminismError: crypto randomness is not available in queries and mutations; use an action`. The globals are an allowlist (`loams_live_js::GLOBALS`): besides timers, `fetch` and `WebAssembly`, `performance`, `WeakRef`, `FinalizationRegistry`, `Atomics` and `SharedArrayBuffer` are absent (clock and GC timing are not deterministic). Built-ins are deep-frozen and global bindings read-only; the global object stays extensible. Assigning an inherited `constructor`, `toString`, `valueOf`, `toLocaleString`, or an error's `name` or `message` defines an own property (override taming, as in SES), so `this.name = "MyError"` works. **Local time is UTC** (fix round 1, I1, closing the first version's known gap): the local-time getters and setters (`getHours`, `setDate`, `getYear`, `setYear`, …) are their UTC twins, `getTimezoneOffset` is 0 (`NaN` for an invalid date), `toString`, `toDateString`, `toTimeString` and the `toLocale*` forms print UTC in QuickJS's formats with `GMT+0000`, `Date()` called as a function prints the start timestamp that way, the multi-argument constructor is `Date.UTC`'s arithmetic, and a date-time without a zone in `Date.parse` or `new Date(string)` is read as UTC. The parser is QuickJS's own two (ISO and the legacy forms), ported to the prelude so that it never consults the host's zone; a zone in the string (`Z`, `±hh:mm`, `GMT+0100`, `EST`, …) still applies. Tested by running the suite's body in child processes with `TZ` set to three zones. `Math`'s transcendental functions use the host's libm, so nodes built for different platforms could disagree in the last bit; §20 §6.2 notes it. | §20 §6.2 | A date string QuickJS's C parser reads differently from the port would parse differently from upstream QuickJS (the port is line for line) |
| T3-6 | **Out of memory is uncatchable** (rewritten in fix round 1, I2). QuickJS's own memory limit raises a catchable `InternalError: out of memory`, so a handler that caught it kept running. Each runtime now allocates through `loams-live-js-alloc`'s `LimitedAllocator` (rquickjs's `RustAllocator` with every block counted against a `MemoryMeter`; QuickJS's own limit is unset). Past `memory_limit` an allocation is refused and the meter's flag set; the interrupt handler sees the flag, grants 64 KiB of grace (set, not added, so repeated stops never accumulate) so QuickJS can allocate the error that stops the call, and stops it uncatchably. From then on no more of the call's jobs run (the slot drives the job queue itself instead of `Promise::finish`) and no host call is made. The call is `FUNCTION_OUT_OF_MEMORY` whenever the flag is set, even if its handler caught QuickJS's error and returned, and the runtime is replaced. Out of memory is classified by the flag only: a thrown `InternalError("out of memory")` or a thrown `null` is a `FUNCTION_ERROR`. `loams-live-js-alloc` is a crate of its own because implementing the allocator trait takes `unsafe`: its lints are the workspace's with `unsafe_code = "deny"` (not `forbid`), and each `unsafe` site has `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` and a SAFETY comment, as in `loams-agentd`. | Fix round 1 controller decision: a small dedicated crate may use `unsafe` for the counting allocator | The grace lets a stopped call allocate up to 64 KiB past the limit before it unwinds |
| T3-7 | **Array methods that QuickJS runs without interrupt checks** (corrected in fix round 1, C3). `join` (so `toString`), `toLocaleString`, `reverse`, `slice`, `splice`, `shift`, `unshift`, `copyWithin`, `sort`, `fill`, `with`, `toReversed`, `toSorted`, `toSpliced`, `concat`, `flat` and `flatMap` loop in C over every index of a generic array-like: on `Array(2 ** 32 - 1)` they ran for minutes past the CPU limit (measured). The prelude wraps them to refuse an array-like longer than `max(memory_limit / 16, 65 536)` with a `RangeError` (a dense array that long would exceed the memory limit). The guard must read the length exactly as the built-in will: the first version read `length` through getters, Proxies and `valueOf`, so a length that answered 1 to the guard and 2^32 − 1 to the built-in ran unbounded, and it checked only `concat` arguments that were arrays, while `concat` spreads any object with `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`. Now the guard reads the length once, with no user code between its read and the built-in's, and refuses with a `TypeError` a Proxy on the receiver's prototype chain, a `length` getter other than the typed arrays' own, and a `length` that is an object. `concat` and `flat` read several lengths with user code (element getters) in between, so they are written in JavaScript in the prelude, where the interrupt handler is polled; they return plain arrays (no `Symbol.species`). **Not every C loop is covered:** `JSON.stringify` of a huge sparse array ran about 1 s past the limit before running out of memory at 32 MiB, and `Array.from` of a huge array-like and the string methods are likewise bounded by memory, not by the CPU limit. In-process mode cannot stop them, which is why it runs trusted code only (T3-10). | The in-process mode cannot kill a thread | A built-in loop not covered here overruns the CPU limit; T3-10 confines that to trusted code, and Task 5's wall-clock kill bounds it for untrusted code |
| T3-8 | **`loams-live` additions.** `LiveError::{FunctionError(String), FunctionTimeout { function, limit }, FunctionOutOfMemory { function, limit }}`, mapped to `ERROR_CODE_FUNCTION_ERROR`, `_TIMEOUT` and `_OUT_OF_MEMORY`. `CallOutput { logs: Vec<LogLine { level, line, truncated }>, dropped }` and `LogLevel`. `Mutated.output` (the committing attempt's lines only) and `Queried.output`. `LiveTxn::{output, output_mut}`. A long line is cut at a character boundary and marked `truncated`; lines past the limit are counted in `dropped`. A failed call returns only its error, so its console lines are lost. | Task 10's `logs::Ring` is fed from `CallOutput.logs`, adding `ts`, `request_id` and `function` | Task 10 decides whether failed calls' lines reach the ring |
| T3-9 | **Tests beyond the brief's names.** `functions.rs`: `bundle_lists_its_functions`, `bundle_load_refuses_bad_bundles`, `function_errors_map_to_live_errors`, `values_round_trip_between_rust_and_javascript`. `limits.rs`: `bundle_top_level_is_limited_too`, `uninterruptible_array_methods_refuse_huge_arrays`. `determinism.rs`: `globals_are_frozen_but_overridable_by_own_properties`. Fix round 1 adds: `determinism.rs` `leftover_jobs_never_run_in_the_next_call`, `bundle_top_level_jobs_run_within_its_limits` (C1) and `local_time_methods_are_utc` (I1, children under three `TZ` values); `limits.rs` `value_conversion_is_budgeted` (C2, in a child process), new cases in `uninterruptible_array_methods_refuse_huge_arrays` (C3: getter, Proxy, `valueOf` and inherited lengths, spreadable `concat`, lengths changed by element getters, and the newly guarded methods) and in `allocation_bomb_hits_memory_limit` (I2: `bombCaught` must be `FUNCTION_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, a catch loop and a write after the limit are stopped, a spoofed out-of-memory error and a thrown `null` are function errors); `functions.rs` `storage_errors_in_host_calls_are_never_swallowed` (I3, through the hidden `LiveTxn::fail_next_store_call`) and `patch_with_an_undefined_field_is_refused`. Tests that could abort the runner run their body in a child process (`common::run_child`). The store-backed tests are `live_test!`s (embedded, and TiKV with `LOAMS_TEST_PD`). CI's `live-embedded` job and the rustdoc-links step now include `loams-live-js`; the `live-embedded` path filter (`crates/loams-live*/**`) and the TiKV job's package list already covered it. | Sandbox escapes and limits are security-critical | None |
| T3-10 | **In-process isolation runs trusted, single-tenant code only** (fix round 1, controller decision). The slots of T3-2 (`Isolation::InProcess` once Task 5 adds it) serve desktop, `loams dev` and single-tenant deployments, whose operator wrote or trusts the bundle. They cannot bound every C built-in's CPU (T3-7), and a slot thread cannot be killed. Multi-tenant serving requires Task 5's isolated worker, which must kill a worker whose call runs past `cpu_limit` plus a grace from outside the process (a mandatory wall-clock kill), with a test that a call stuck in a C built-in is killed and the next call succeeds. | QuickJS's C built-ins loop without polling the interrupt handler; only a separate process can be stopped reliably | If in-process mode served untrusted code, one bundle could hold a slot's CPU for minutes |

Task 4 (the host API: `ctx.db`, pagination, argument validators, visibility, 2026-10-10).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4-1 | **`CallCtx` rides on the `LiveTxn`, not in `Function::call`'s signature.** `loams_live::CallCtx { identity: Option<Identity>, request_id: String, deployment: Option<String> }`; `LiveTxn::{ctx, set_ctx}` replace Task 3's `request_id`/`set_request_id`. `Identity` is an uninhabited enum until Task 16 (the T20-4 pattern), so `identity` is always `None`; `deployment` stays `None` until Task 6. The runner sets `request_id` to a mutation's idempotency key; queries get an empty one. | `Function` has a dozen implementations across the suites; the context belongs to the call as the transaction does | Task 16 fills `identity` where the service builds the `LiveTxn` |
| T4-2 | **`Visibility` moves to `loams-live`** (`loams_live::Visibility`, re-exported by `loams-live-js`). `Function::visibility()` defaults to `Public` (row T0-13); a JavaScript function reports its builder's. The `_system:*` functions stay public here; Task 12 makes them admin-only. Nothing enforces visibility yet (Task 15). | The trait is in `loams-live` | None |
| T4-3 | **The cursor key is the catalog record `KIND_APP` / `"cursor"`** (`AppKeys::cursor_key`): 32 random bytes, written by `Runner::open` in the transaction that writes the journal shard count, so an app that predates Task 4 gets one on its next open. It never changes. `LiveTxn` reads it once per transaction, outside the read set. Not a field of `AppDef`, which `set_journal_shards` rewrites whole. | "A catalog record created with the app", without a proto change | Rotating the key would invalidate every cursor; none is planned |
| T4-4 | **Cursor codec as the brief, with these details.** `loams_live::cursor::{CursorKey, KeyBound { index, key }, encode, decode}`; the tag is HMAC-SHA256 (crate `hmac` 0.13, already in the lockfile, on sha2 0.11's digest) cut to 16 bytes and checked in constant time; text over 16 KiB is refused. Every refusal is the new `LiveError::BadCursor` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`), and the new `LiveError::reason()` names it `live_bad_cursor`, registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`. The wire `LiveError` has no reason field yet: Task 12/19 carries `reason()` into `ErrorInfo`. `paginate` also refuses a genuine cursor of another index, or of the same index id on another table (the key must start with that index's prefix). A cursor does not bind the range's `eq` or bounds: reused on another range of the same index it only narrows that range, whose keys are all a read can reach. An empty key is a start cursor and is accepted on any index. | Tenant fence (Review Focus 2) and no forged positions; one error class for every failure, so a probe learns nothing | A client that wants a cursor bound to its exact query must not reuse it; reads never leave the range either way |
| T4-5 | **Pagination semantics.** `LiveTxn::paginate(range, cursor, num_items) -> Page { docs, continue_cursor, is_done }`. `is_done` means the page came back short, so a range whose size is a multiple of `numItems` ends with an empty, done page (as Convex). The cursor after the last page still marks the end, so documents added later are read from there; an empty page keeps the position it started from. A page of a table that does not exist is empty and done, with a start cursor (`LiveTxn::empty_page`); a positioned cursor there is `BadCursor`, since R1 never removes a table (CodeRabbit on #387). `numItems` is 1 to `max_scanned_docs`. Read set: from the resume point to the page's last key when the page is full (`paginate_read_set_ends_at_last_key`), to the end of the range when it is short. `docs::scan_after` is `scan` with a resume key and the last key read. | The brief's `{ page, continueCursor, isDone }` without an extra read past the page: reading one more key would make the read set cover it, so an insert just after the page would invalidate it | A client sees one empty last page when the range divides evenly |
| T4-6 | **The validator vocabulary** (`loams_live::validate::{Validator, PathElem, FieldViolation, check, check_ids, describe, render_path, MAX_VIOLATIONS}`). Types are strict: `int64` is `I64` (a `bigint`), `float64` is `F64` (a number). An object has exactly its fields; `optional` marks a field that may be missing (refused anywhere else when the bundle loads; `check` treats a stray one as its inner validator). `literal` is a scalar (null, boolean, a finite number, an int64 `bigint`, a string). A union has at least one member. `check` checks an `id(table)` for form and checksum only; `check_ids` also checks its table against resolved ids, and the argument check resolves them in the call's transaction (a missing table joins the read set). Violations name the path (`$.a[3]["b c"]`) and types, never the value, and are capped at 16. | One checker for arguments now and schemas in Task 8; no user data in errors | Task 8 may want a stored (proto) form of `Validator`; the JavaScript descriptor is only the bundle's |
| T4-7 | **The JavaScript surface.** `v` is exported from `loams:server` (the only module a bundle can import; Convex has it in `convex/values`). A function's `args` is an object of validators or a `v.object(…)`; anything else fails the load. The validator objects are frozen `{ kind, … }` descriptors, read into `Validator`s when the bundle loads (`loams-live-js/src/validators.rs`), so `FunctionMeta.args` is `Some` for every function that declares `args`. Arguments are checked in Rust before the call is queued for a slot: a refusal is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, "`<path>`: the arguments do not match its validator: `$.n`: expected int64, got string", and the handler never runs. No reason string is attached (the brief names none). `FunctionMeta` is no longer `Eq` (a literal may hold an `f64`). The `ctx.db` host operations moved to `loams-live-js/src/host.rs`, which adds `paginate`. | A refused call has no effect and costs no JavaScript | A bundler that emits `convex/values` imports must rewrite them to `loams:server` (Task 36) |
| T4-8 | **Tests beyond the brief's names.** `crates/loams-live/tests/cursor.rs`: `cursor_roundtrips_and_names_its_index` and `every_flipped_bit_is_rejected` (every bit of a cursor, garbage, another key; no store); `forged_cursor_rejected` also refuses another index's and another table's genuine cursor and accepts a cursor after a reopen. `crates/loams-live-js/tests/functions.rs`: `paginate_in_javascript` (pages, the read set, a forged cursor escaping as `live_bad_cursor` and caught inside a handler, bad options). `tests/validators.rs`: `validator_definitions_are_checked_at_load`, `violation_paths_render_like_javascript`; `validator_vocabulary_roundtrip` runs 96 cases and requires at least half to mutate a value. `paginate_on_a_missing_table` (review of #387). A union member is checked only up to its first violation. Unit tests in `validate.rs`, `cursor.rs`, `validators.rs` and `host.rs`. The ordered pagination tests page a unique user index: documents inserted in the same millisecond share a `_creationTime`, so `by_creation_time` orders them by id. | Review Focus 2 and 4 | None |
| T4-9 | **`loams-live-proto`'s build script reads `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` at run time** and reruns only when it or the five protos change (separate commit; the Task 3 follow-up). | A build script compiled in one worktree is reused by another through the shared target dir, with the first worktree's path baked in by `env!` | None |
| T5-1 | **A worker is a slot in a process.** `WorkerPool::spawn(app, bundle_bytes, config) -> WorkerHandle` serves one (node, app, deployment) with up to `contexts` worker processes, each running one call at a time on its main thread with the same `Engine` (prelude, frozen globals, one context per call, interrupt handler, counting allocator) the in-process slots use. `Bundle::load` with `Isolation::Isolated` spawns `<this binary> live-worker` (`WorkerCommand::current_exe`); `Bundle: From<WorkerHandle>`. A call's host link is a trait (`HostLink`): channels in process, frames in a worker; the caller's side (`HostDriver`) runs `ctx.db` on the call's `LiveTxn`, keeps the errors JavaScript sees by index and turns a storage error into an uncatchable abort, so both modes behave the same. Arguments are validated on the host before any worker runs. | One engine, two placements; `functions_suite_runs_isolated` proves the semantics match | A process per concurrent call: memory per deployment up to `contexts × (memory_limit + 64 MiB)` |
| T5-2 | **The protocol as built** (`proto/loams/live/worker/v1/worker.proto`, package `loams.live.worker.v1`, generated in `loams-live-proto`): `HostMessage{Load, Invoke, HostReply, Probe}`, `WorkerMessage{Loaded, HostCall, Done, ProbeDone}`; `Load` carries the bundle and limits, `Loaded` the functions (validators as `v` descriptors, which the host parses again) or the load failure; `Invoke.ctx` is `{start_ts, request_id, result_bytes, host_bytes}` (the worker derives `Date` and the `Math.random` seed as in process); `Done{result \| error, logs, dropped, cpu_ns, retire}`. The host treats a worker as hostile: frames are capped at 64 MiB and decoded with a recursion limit of 160, a host-error index or limit name it did not issue is refused, console lines are cut to the limits again, timeouts and out-of-memory errors carry the host's own limits, and any frame out of turn is a crash. `Probe` is a test hook (`WorkerHandle::probe`, hidden). §44 §7.2's `loams.live` row names the package as internal, which `route_map`'s package guard requires. | Ruling 5 named the messages only | `sdks/go/buf.gen.go.yaml` and `sdks/cpp/buf.gen.yaml` read the whole `proto/` module and have no mapping for the new file, as for `graph`, `postgres` and `collection` today: SDK owner's follow-up |
| T5-3 | **The sandbox as built** (`sandbox_linux.rs`), applied after the worker reads `Load` and creates its runtime, before it evaluates the bundle: landlock ABI v6, best effort (every filesystem and TCP access handled and none granted, signals and abstract UNIX sockets scoped); `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`; `RLIMIT_NOFILE` = 3; `RLIMIT_AS` = **the address space already mapped (`VmSize`) +** memory limit + 64 MiB, since the binary's own mappings count (the debug `loams` binary maps over 1 GiB; the brief's figure alone would leave no room); seccomp `KILL_PROCESS` on anything outside the allowlist, synchronised to all threads. The allowlist is the brief's plus **`mremap`**: glibc's `realloc` of a large block uses it, and without it every isolated test that builds a large string dies with `SIGSYS` (checked by removing it). The worker refuses to sandbox itself with more than one thread (landlock and `no_new_privs` bind the calling thread), so `loams live-worker` is dispatched in `main` before the tokio runtime and the log subscriber start (`main` now parses the CLI, then calls the async `serve`). The host starts workers with an empty environment and `TZ=UTC0` (no zone file read), piped stdio, `kill_on_drop`, and forwards at most 64 stderr chunks of 1 KiB to its log. No `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`: it fires on the exit of the spawning *thread*, which in a tokio pool is not the host; a host that dies closes the worker's stdin instead. | The brief's list; a landlock-less kernel still gets seccomp | `RLIMIT_AS` is larger than the brief says by the mapped size; a kernel without landlock logs one line and relies on seccomp |
| T5-4 | **Limits in a worker.** The interrupt handler stops ordinary code at `cpu_limit`, as in process. The host kills a worker whose call has run JavaScript longer than `cpu_limit` + `KILL_GRACE` (500 ms; time waiting on host calls excluded) and answers `FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`; loading has `cpu_limit` + 500 ms + 10 s for the exec and sandbox. A kill for time is not a crash. A worker whose runtime ran out of memory answers with `retire` and exits, so its process is never reused (row T3-10); after a timeout, an abort or leftover jobs it replaces its runtime in process, as a slot does. Stuck C built-ins found while writing `stuck_builtin_is_killed_by_the_wall_clock`: `JSON.stringify` of a huge sparse array ran in process until the transaction's 10 s deadline and `"ab".repeat(2 ** 28)` 1.3 s past a 200 ms limit; `includes`, `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` on sparse arrays do poll the interrupt. | Row T3-10 | None |
| T5-5 | **Crashes and degradation.** A worker that dies or breaks the protocol fails its call with the new `LiveError::WorkerCrashed` (`FUNCTION_ERROR`, reason `live_worker_crashed`, registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`); the message names the function and how the worker ended (for example `was killed by signal 31 (SIGSYS)`). A mutation is not retried (only `LiveError::Txn` is). The next call starts a fresh worker after `restart_delay` (10 ms doubling to 5 s while crashes repeat; reset after a quiet minute). The fifth crash within 60 s sets `WorkerHandle::degraded()` (sticky) and logs an error; calls are still served. Task 6 maps it to `DeploymentState::Degraded`; Task 27 counts `worker_restarts_total`. | §45 §3.1 | None |
| T5-6 | **Configuration.** The engine has no config file, so `[live] isolation` and `[live] tenancy` are `LiveConfig::{isolation, tenancy}` (`loams_live::{Isolation, Tenancy}`, re-exported by `loams-live-js`; `JsConfig::isolation`), set by `--live-isolation in_process\|isolated` and `--live-tenancy single\|multi` on `dev` and `standalone`. `loams_live::check_isolation` refuses `multi` without `isolated` with `live: tenancy = "multi" needs isolation = "isolated" (Linux only)` (`LiveError::IsolationRequired`), and `isolated` off Linux (`IsolationUnavailable`); `ServerConfig::validate` and `LiveServer::start` call it. The server does not run deployed functions yet: Task 6 creates a `WorkerPool` for `isolated` deployments. | No `[live]` section exists to extend | A config file later maps onto the same fields |
| T5-7 | **Tests beyond the brief's names, and how the suite runs isolated.** `functions_suite_runs_isolated` is a module at the end of each Task 3/4 suite (`functions`, `limits`, `determinism`, `validators`) that reruns every test with a task-local switch making `common::try_load` spawn workers from the crate's own `loams-live-worker` binary (`src/bin/`, the same `worker_main` as `loams live-worker`); child-process tests address their isolated case by path (`common::case_path`). Linux only. Added: `crates/loams/tests/live_dev.rs` `live_worker_subcommand_serves_functions_sandboxed` (the real binary: a mutation and a query in the worker, then `SIGSYS` on open), `main.rs` `live_isolation_and_tenancy_flags`, and unit tests for framing, failure and log conversion, validator descriptors, host op names and the sandbox's filter. `host_call_latency_recorded` (debug build): trivial call p50 3.1 ms in both modes; `ctx.db.get` round trip p50 0.27 ms in process, 0.6 ms isolated. The worker's host-side loop is `worker.rs`; the process side is **`child.rs`** (not in the brief's file list). | Review Focus 3 | None |
| T5-8 | **`live` includes the function runtime** (CodeRabbit on #394 asked for a separate feature). The default `live` feature now builds `loams-live-js` (rquickjs and its C build), as the plan's file structure intends (`loams-live-js` with `rquickjs`; `crates/loams` features `live` and `live-tikv` only). Functions are Live's API: Task 6's deploys and the desktop's Live page run them in every Live build, in process by default, so a build with Live and no function runtime would refuse every deploy. QuickJS is vendored C built with `cc`, not a git pin, and the default build already compiles C (`zstd`, `ring`). Also from that review: an idle worker found dead is dropped before a call, not counted as a crash (`a_worker_that_died_idle_is_replaced_without_a_crash`), and `live_worker_crashed`'s registry code is `internal`, provisional until Task 19 maps Live's codes to Connect. | Live without functions is not a useful variant | Default builds need a C compiler for QuickJS, as they already do for zstd |

Task 6 (deployments: records, storage and activation, 2026-10-11).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T6-1 | **The runtime sits behind a trait.** `loams-live-js` depends on `loams-live`, so `deploy.rs` reaches it through `deploy::{BundleLoader, LoadedBundle}`. A `deploy::Runtime { bundles: loams_store::Store, loader }` pairs it with the bundle store. `loams-live-js` implements both traits: `JsLoader::{new, with_workers}` loads a bundle in process or on a `WorkerPool`, by `JsConfig::isolation`, and `Bundle` is a `LoadedBundle`. `LiveServer::start_with(config, runtime, shutdown)` is new. `LiveServer::start` uses `Runtime::none()`, so only the `_system:*` functions serve and `Deploy` is `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. `loams-live` takes `loams-live-js` as a dev-dependency, a cycle that only its integration tests link. | `loams-live` cannot depend on `loams-live-js` | None |
| T6-2 | **A minimal `AppEngine`, in `deploy.rs`.** It holds `{name, runner, runtime, the deployment it serves}` and has `open`, `active` (the deployment this node serves), `read_active` (the catalog's pointer) and `refresh`. Task 13 adds the subscriptions, sessions and tailer, moves it to `engines.rs` and starts engines lazily. `deploy` takes `by: &str`, the principal id, rather than `&Principal`, until Tasks 14 and 15; unauthenticated callers are `deploy::UNAUTHENTICATED`. `Page<T>` and `PageRequest { after, limit }` (default 100, at most 1 000, newest first) are in `deploy`, since the root already has `txn::Page`. | `AppEngine` and `Principal` do not exist yet | Task 13 moves the type |
| T6-3 | **Catalog layout.** The pointer is kind `0x03` with an empty name, and its value is the active id's 16 bytes. Records are a new kind `0x06`, named by the 16-byte ULID, with value `loams.live.v1.DeploymentRecord`. That message and `DeploymentState` are in `catalog.proto`, which now imports `live.proto` for `Schema`. The schema record (kind `0x04`) holds `Schema`. `parent` is the request's `expected_active`, which is the replaced deployment once the deploy is active. `expected_active = None` means "the app has no active deployment", not "unconditional". Ids come from a per-engine monotonic ULID generator. | Separate kinds keep the record range from containing the pointer | None |
| T6-4 | **Order and failures.** Steps 4 and 5 run as one transaction: the pointer CAS, `schema::apply`, the new record `active`, the previous record (`active` or `degraded`) `superseded`, and the pointer. Before anything is written: the schema's static checks and the bundle's validation (loading it in a scratch runtime, which then serves it if the deploy activates). Failures at those steps write nothing. A conflict, or a schema the catalog refuses, marks the record `failed` with the reason. A storage error leaves it `pending`, since the outcome may be unknown; marking failed only ever moves a record out of `pending`. A real deploy does not pre-check `expected_active` (§45's order puts the CAS at step 5); a dry run does, read-only. The new `LiveError::DeployConflict` is `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_deploy_conflict` (registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`), and its message names both deployments. The losing node then refreshes and serves the winner. | §45 §3.3's order | A stale client leaves a failed record and a bundle, which retention deletes |
| T6-5 | **(Index changes amended by Task 9, rows T9-1 to T9-7: an existing table's indexes change online.)** **Schemas are additive** (`schema::{Schema, TableSchema, SchemaChanges, check, plan, apply, load}`). A missing declared table is created with its indexes. A table the schema leaves out is untouched. An existing table whose indexes differ, by name and fields in any order, is `FAILED_PRECONDITION` until Task 9. An empty schema removes the schema record, so tables are created on insert again; with any declared table, an insert into an undeclared one is `NOT_FOUND`, as before. | The brief: "only additive table creation" | A user whose existing table needs a new index waits for Task 9 |
| T6-6 | **Loading and integrity.** A deploy stores the bundle, then reads it back and checks the hash. Every load (open, refresh) checks the SHA-256. A mismatch is `LiveError::Corrupt`, logged at error level, and the node keeps serving what it served. A node with nothing loaded keeps the load error, which its deployed functions return. `_system:*` functions always resolve first (`resolve`, and `resolve_system` for system-only resolvers such as the checker). `AppEngine::open` fails only when the pointer cannot be read. **Cross-node pickup:** until Task 11's catalog entry, the server's janitor round (`janitor_interval`, 60 s) refreshes each node, so a deploy made on another node is served within one round. | No catalog journal entry yet | Up to one janitor interval of skew between nodes |
| T6-7 | **(Amended by T7-5: the janitor now fails abandoned `pending` records.)** **Retention** (`deploy::retain`, run in the server's janitor round). It keeps the newest 50 records, the active one and its parent, and deletes the other records in one transaction. It then deletes their bundles, and any bundle no record names whose ULID is older than `ORPHAN_BUNDLE_AGE` (1 h). A younger orphan may belong to a deploy that stored its bundle and has not yet written its record. Old `pending` records are not failed by the janitor. | §45 §3.3, Q636 | A deploy that crashed between steps 3 and 5 stays `pending` until retention drops it |
| T6-8 | **Degraded and the deployment id.** `WorkerHandle::degraded_signal()` (a `watch`) turns on with `degraded()`; `LoadedBundle::degraded()` hands it over. The engine marks the record `active → degraded` once. A later deploy supersedes it, and the watcher stops when the deployment is no longer served. `Function::deployment() -> Ulid` defaults to nil. `SubKey` gains `deployment` (nil from `SubKey::new`), and sessions use `SubKey::for_function`. A deployed function's call sets `CallCtx.deployment` to the ULID text. | §45 §3.1, §3.3 | None |
| T6-9 | **The server runs deployments.** `LiveService.Deploy` (until Task 10 moves it to `LiveAdminService`) deploys against `read_active()`, with an empty message, as `unauthenticated`. Its response's `deployment_id` is the ULID text. `crates/loams` gives Live the data bucket (`<data-dir>/bucket` or `--bucket`) and a `JsLoader` with `--live-isolation`, so `isolated` deployments run in `loams live-worker` children of the server. Tests beyond the brief: `schema_creates_tables_additively`, `degraded_workers_mark_the_deployment_degraded` (fake loader) and `live_service_deploys_and_serves_functions` in `tests/deploy.rs`; `deployments_run_in_isolated_workers` and `degraded_workers_mark_their_deployment_degraded` (real workers) in `loams-live-js/tests/worker.rs`; `dev_serves_deployed_functions` in `crates/loams/tests/live_dev.rs` (both modes, across a restart); unit tests in `deploy.rs` and `schema.rs`. CI's `live-embedded` filter adds `crates/loams-store/**`. The TypeScript facade and the facade generator's goldens are regenerated: they had been stale since Task 5 and lacked `live_worker_crashed` and `loams.live.worker.v1`. | The carry-in from Task 5 | None |

Task 7 (rollback and activation semantics, 2026-10-11).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T7-1 | **Rollback activates the existing record; it writes no new one.** `deploy::activate(app, id, expected_active, by)` reads the record, refuses a `pending` one (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`, its deploy has not finished), checks the schema statically, reads the bundle and checks its SHA-256 (`CORRUPT` on a mismatch or a missing object), loads it in a scratch runtime, and then runs the same step 4–5 transaction as a deploy (`commit`/`swap` in `deploy.rs`): the pointer CAS against `expected_active` (a mismatch is `live_deploy_conflict`, and no record changes), `schema::apply` of the record's schema, the record `active`, the replaced one `superseded`. The record keeps its contents (creator, message, parent); `by` is logged only. Any state but `pending` can be activated (`superseded`, `failed`, `degraded`, `active`); activating the active deployment with itself expected loads it afresh, and every subscription reruns. An unknown id is `NOT_FOUND`. | §45 §3.3: no second path; records are immutable but for their state | Retention protects the active deployment and *its* parent, not the deployment rolled back from; that one is newer than the active one, so it stays among the newest 50 in practice |
| T7-2 | **(Amended by T8-6: the spawned task also runs step 4, the validation, as `deploy::finish`.)** **The engine publishes what it serves, and the subscription manager follows it.** `AppEngine::serving()` is a `watch::Receiver<deploy::Serving>`: `generation` (bumped on every change), `at` (the activation's commit timestamp, or the snapshot at which a node read the pointer on open or refresh), `switching` (activations of this node in flight) and the served deployment (`Serving::{deployment, resolve}`). `Subscriptions::spawn_for(&AppEngine, config, shutdown)` follows it (`LiveServer` uses it; `spawn` follows nothing, as before). The manager *adopts* a deployment: every subscription of a deployed function runs in the adopted deployment, whichever one the subscriber resolved against (it is resolved again by name, and keyed by the adopted id). A tick never reads before the adopted deployment's `at`. When the generation moves, the next tick reads at `max(lagged now, at)`, resolves every deployed subscription again in the new deployment, reruns **every** subscription once (system ones too, so the activation's new tables show) and publishes them all, changed or not, so a session's Transition at that tick holds only new results (`SubResult.deployment` names the deployment that computed a result). **Hold:** while `switching > 0` the manager takes no tick; it reads the time first and the state after, so a tick that sees no activation in flight reads before any later activation's commit, and one that sees it finished adopts it. The `Switching` guard is dropped after the post-swap `refresh` on a conflict or an unknown outcome. Steps 4–5 and the serve (or refresh) run in a spawned task, so a caller that is dropped mid-swap (a client that disconnects) cannot leave a committed activation unserved on its node (CodeRabbit on #440). | §45 §3.3: "at the activation tick every subscription of the app reruns once on the new code; sessions see one Transition at that tick" | Ticks stall for the length of an activation's transaction (milliseconds) |
| T7-3 | **Queries opened before a deploy move to it.** With a following manager, a session query whose function does not resolve (nothing deployed, not exported, the deployment failed to load) is still subscribed, as `subs::Target::Missing { name, error }`, holding its error (`NOT_FOUND` for an unexported name) and resolved again at every activation; it is not rerun on ticks in between and has no read set. A name that now resolves to a mutation holds `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. No session is closed by an activation. A query that resolved in an older deployment moves at the activation tick. `Subscriptions::{subscribe_target, follows}` are new; sessions keep the `Target` for a lagged resubscribe. Without a following manager the old behaviour stands (a resolve error is the query's fixed result). | The carry from Task 6: subscriptions opened before a deploy kept the old deployment | A session pays one subscription per unresolved query |
| T7-4 | **The rerun counter counts evaluations.** `SubsStats::reruns` rises by the number of subscriptions evaluated, so an activation adds exactly the number of distinct `SubKey`s (a `Missing` one is not evaluated and is not counted). | `activation_reruns_every_subscription_once` | None |
| T7-5 | **The janitor fails abandoned `pending` records** (carry from Task 6, row T6-7). `retain` (the janitor round) fails, in its trim transaction, every kept `pending` record whose `created_at_ms` is `PENDING_GRACE` (10 min) or more behind the transaction's start timestamp (store time), with the reason "the deploy did not finish …"; `Retained.abandoned` lists them, and a warning is logged per record. It only moves `pending`, so it is idempotent. A deploy's swap now reads its own record inside the transaction and refuses (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`) one that is no longer `pending`, so a deploy whose record the janitor failed cannot activate it. `deploy::retain_with(app, grace)` is a hidden test hook. A failed record can still be activated (T7-1). | A crashed deploy left `pending` until retention dropped it | A deploy stalled more than 10 minutes between its pending write and its swap fails; it can be activated afterward |
| T7-6 | **Cross-node switching is unchanged (Task 11).** A node that picks up another node's activation on refresh (janitor round, ≤ 60 s, row T6-6) adopts it at the snapshot it read the pointer at; its ticks between the remote commit and that refresh ran the old deployment. The hold protocol covers activations of the node itself only. Task 11's catalog journal entry switches every node at the activation's tick. | Out of scope by the dispatch | Up to one janitor interval of old results on other nodes |
| T7-7 | **The reactive checker deploys.** It now runs on an `AppEngine` with its own Rust `BundleLoader` (bundle `checker-v<n>` is version `n`; no JavaScript, since `loams-live` cannot depend on `loams-live-js`), whose `chk:query` and `chk:get` wrap `_system:query` and `_system:get` as `{ v: n, r: … }`. Version 1 is deployed before the sessions open; `Disturbance::Deploy` deploys the next version and `Rollback` activates the one before the current one (`Report.activations`, `Report.deployments_seen`). Every fresh evaluation runs the version the pointer names at the evaluation's timestamp (`deploy::active_at`), so a result of the wrong deployment at a Transition's `end.ts` is a `Stale` violation. `Deploy` and `Rollback` are no longer `Unwired`; `reactive_checker_reports_unwired_disturbances` uses `AddIndex`. | Review Focus 1 across deploys | None |
| T7-8 | **Files and tests beyond the brief.** Besides `deploy.rs`: `subs.rs` (following, `Target`, `SubResult.deployment`), `session.rs` (missing targets, the hidden `Sessions::trace_deployments` hook and `TransitionDeployments`, the "test hook" of `no_session_sees_mixed_deployments`), `service.rs` (`spawn_for`), `txn.rs` (`snapshot` is `pub(crate)`), `testing/checker.rs` and `testing/mod.rs` (`live_test!` takes `#[ignore = "…"]` first and puts it on both cases). `rollback_reapplies_previous_schema` is written in full and ignored until Task 9 (an index change on an existing table is refused until then, row T6-5). Added test: `janitor_fails_abandoned_pending_deploys`. `rollback_restores_previous_functions` also covers a stale `expected_active`, an unknown id, re-activating the active deployment and a corrupt bundle; `no_session_sees_mixed_deployments` opens its sessions before the first deploy and runs a writer through two deploys and a rollback. | Brief | None |

Task 8 (schema validators, 2026-10-12).

| T8-1 | **The validator's proto is in `live.proto`, not `catalog.proto`.** `TableSchema` is in `live.proto`, which `catalog.proto` imports, and a deploy sends it, so `Validator` (a `oneof` of `primitive`, `array`, `object`, `literal`, `union`, `optional`, `id`), `ValidatorPrimitive`, `ValidatorObject` and `ValidatorUnion` live there, with `TableSchema.validator = 3` and `optional bool schema_validation = 4` (absent means true). `catalog.proto` gains `TableDef.validator = 6`, `TableDef.enforcing = 7` (`EnforcingValidator { validator, deployment }`), `TableJobRecord`, `TableJobKind` and `JobFinding`. `schema_validation` is **per table**, as §45 §4.1 says ("a table can opt out"), not schema-wide as in Convex. `Schema::from_proto` now returns a `Result`: a validator with no kind, or nested deeper than 64, is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The `@loams/live` stubs are regenerated. | `live.proto` cannot import `catalog.proto` (a cycle), and the catalog stays internal | A client builds validators as protobuf messages until Task 37's CLI emits them from `v.*` |
| T8-2 | **Enforcement.** A table's validators ride in its catalog record (`TableDef.validation: TableValidation { validator, enforcing }`), which every write already loads. `docs::insert`, `patch` (the merged document) and `replace` call `schema::check_document` first, for deployed and `_system:*` functions alike. An `id(table)` is resolved in the write's transaction. A failure is the new `LiveError::SchemaViolation { message, violations }`: `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, reason `live_schema_violation` (registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`), with `LiveError::field_violations()`. The message names the table, the paths and the types, never a value, and names the deployment when the stricter validator a deploy is checking refused the write. The wire `LiveError` carries the message only until Task 19 maps `field_violations` (as T4-4 did for `reason`). **Shape:** a table validator is a `v.object` or a union of them, over the document's own fields (no empty or `_` names); `optional` appears only as a field; at most 64 deep and 4 096 nodes (`Validator::check_table`). `validate::check_fields` checks a document's fields in place. **`LiveValue` is now `Eq`:** its identity is an equivalence, with NaN as one class. So `Validator`, `Schema` and `DeploymentRecord` stay `Eq`. | §45 §4.1; no user data in errors | Every write pays one walk of its table's validators |
| T8-3 | **Tightening or loosening.** `validate::accepts_all(new, old)` is a conservative subsumption check: `false` when it cannot tell, which only costs a scan. Examples: an `id` only under `string` or the same `id`, a literal under what accepts it, unions member by member, objects field by field, with optional fields. `schema::loosens` treats a missing validator as "any". `SchemaChanges` gains `validators` (existing tables whose validator changes) and `validate` (those whose documents a stricter validator is checked against: not looser, and `schema_validation` set). A dry run reports both. Removing a validator is loosening. A table the schema leaves out keeps its validator (T6-5: such tables are untouched). | §45 §4.1 | A rare loosening that the check cannot prove is scanned |
| T8-4 | **(Amended by T9-3: the fence now runs after step 4's transaction, as one transaction per shard, run concurrently.)** **A fence instead of a lifetime wait.** Step 4's transaction (`live.deploy.validate`) compares the pointer, marks a new deployment `validating`, sets each table's `enforcing` validator, creates its job record and **rewrites every journal head unchanged** (`Journal::fence`; an absent head is deleted). Every mutation that writes also writes a head, so one in flight when the fence commits conflicts and reruns past it, and sees the stricter validator. Every scan batch reads after the fence. So no write the scan cannot see escapes both, without Task 9's `max_mutation_lifetime`. While a check runs, a write must match the old **and** the new validator, so a revert leaves no document the old one refuses. **Finding:** `lock_keys` cannot be the fence. On the embedded store a lock-only key leaves no version, so it makes only the locking transaction conflict, not the others. On TiKV, the Lock record does make the others conflict. `the_journal_fence_makes_mutations_in_flight_rerun` holds both backends to the fence, and fails on embedded with `lock_keys`. R1's `set_journal_shards` relies on `lock_keys` this way, so on embedded it does not fence a concurrent mutation. That is a parity gap, recorded for its owner and not changed here (**fixed by row T21-20**). | §45 §4.1 says "scans at a timestamp after that state commits"; a fence makes that exact on both backends | A tightening deploy makes the mutations in flight rerun once. Under a heavy write load, the fence transaction itself may retry |
| T8-5 | **`backfill::TableJob` as built.** The job record is catalog kind `0x07`, named `table_id ‖ kind`. It holds the deployment, owner, lease expiry, checkpoint, scanned count, `done` and up to 100 `findings`. Each batch is **one transaction** (through the new `txn::atomic`, which rolls back a body's own error; the deploy swap now uses it too). It reads the record and checks the lease, taking it over if it expired. It then reads up to `batch` documents after the checkpoint, runs the `Visitor`, and writes the record with a renewed lease. A failed batch rolls back with its findings, so no document is reported twice or skipped (`table_job_resumes_from_its_checkpoint`). After each batch the job sleeps to keep `docs_per_s`; the renewed lease covers that pause too (PR #446 review). Options are `RunnerOptions.jobs: JobOptions { batch: 256, docs_per_s: 5 000, lease: 30 s }`. **The lease lives in the app's keyspace**, not in `loams-meta`'s leases or an in-process lease (the brief's "Consumes"). That way every node of the app sees it on both backends, and `loams-live` takes no `loams-meta` dependency. API: `create_job`, `load_job`, `delete_job`, `TableJob::{new, run}`, `JobKind::Validate` (Task 9 adds its kind). | One mechanism in cluster and dev mode | A node whose clock jumps can take a lease over early; the old owner's next batch then fails |
| T8-6 | **The deploy path.** Step 4 (`deploy::validate`) runs in `deploy` and in `activate`. A rollback to a stricter schema re-checks the data (T7-1: same path), but `activate` never moves a record to `validating`. `Path::Deploy` accepts a `pending` or `validating` record at the swap; `Path::Activate` refuses both. Tables are checked one after another under one owner (a fresh engine ULID). Findings fail the deploy with `FAILED_PRECONDITION` (no reason string). The message lists the offending ids by table (at most 100, "at least 100 (the check stopped there)" beyond) and describes the first document's violation. The new record is `failed` with the same text. Every failure at step 4 or 5 runs `deploy::fail`, one transaction that releases the deployment's checks (`schema::release`) and fails a `pending` or `validating` record. It replaces `mark_failed`. The swap (`schema::apply`) sets a stricter validator only when the table enforces it for that same deployment, then clears the check and its job; otherwise it is `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. A schema the catalog refuses fails the record at step 4 as it did at step 5. **Detached:** steps 4 and 5 run together in one spawned task (`deploy::finish`, which replaces T7-2's `commit`), so a caller that goes away mid-scan does not leave a stricter validator enforced past the deploy's own outcome (`a_deploy_finishes_when_its_caller_goes_away`). The hidden hook `AppEngine::crash_after_next_fence` stops the next validation right after its fence, as a node death would. | §45 §3.3, §4.1; T7-2's reasoning | A deploy whose client gave up still activates; the client sees it in the deployment list |
| T8-7 | **One check per table, and the janitor.** A table being checked by another deployment with a live job is `FAILED_PRECONDITION` naming that deployment, and the second deploy fails. A check whose deployment has no job with a live lease is abandoned, and is replaced. Liveness is per deployment: a finished job keeps its deployment's other checks alive while one of them still runs. `deploy::retain` (the janitor round) releases abandoned checks in its trim transaction (`schema::release_abandoned`), deletes orphan jobs, and fails `validating` records with no live check ("…its validation jobs' leases expired…"). The new `Retained.validations_released` lists them. | A crashed deploy must not leave a stricter validator enforced forever | A check is released up to 30 s plus one janitor round after its node died |
| T8-8 | **Files and tests beyond the brief.** Files: `catalog.rs` (`TableValidation`, `Enforcing`), `keys.rs` (`KIND_TABLE_JOB`, `table_job`), `docs.rs`, `journal.rs` (`fence`), `txn.rs` (`RunnerOptions.jobs`, `atomic`, `Refusal`), `deploy.rs`, `error.rs`, `value.rs`, `service.rs`, `lib.rs`, `tests/deploy.rs` and `tests/value.rs` (new struct fields), `live.proto`, `docs/api/reasons.md`. Regenerated: the facade goldens, `@loams/client`'s `facade.ts` and `@loams/live`'s stubs. Tests added in `tests/schema.rs`: `a_table_is_validated_by_one_deploy_at_a_time`, `janitor_releases_abandoned_validations`, `a_deploy_finishes_when_its_caller_goes_away`, `table_job_resumes_from_its_checkpoint` and `the_journal_fence_makes_mutations_in_flight_rerun`. Unit tests added in `validate.rs` (wire round trip, shapes, subsumption, document checks), `schema.rs` and `backfill.rs`. The other SDKs' reason registries (`sdks/{python,go,rust,cpp,csharp}`, `sdks/fixtures/error.json`) gain `live_schema_violation` in the SDK owner's next registry sync, as `live_deploy_conflict` did. | Brief | None |

Embedded `lock_keys` parity (2026-10-12, found by Task 8, stacked on it).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T21-20 | **A committed lock is a version on the embedded store, as TiKV's `Lock` record.** A key a transaction locks (`lock_keys`) and does not write gets a lock version (`[0x02]`) at its commit timestamp in `versions`. The commit check counts it like any version, so a transaction started before that commit that writes or locks the key conflicts, whether the key is present or absent. Reads, scans, the insert check and the token sweep skip it (`mvcc::head` returns the newest entry's timestamp and the newest version, locks skipped). A rolled-back lock leaves nothing. GC deletes every lock at or below the safe point, and keeps the newest value beneath. Since GC may then have dropped a lock or tombstone an old transaction would conflict with, **the committer refuses a commit started below the GC safe point** (`Conflict`, so the runner reruns it); a transaction gets there only when it outlives its read window. The seam's `Txn::lock_keys` documents the contract. TiKV is unchanged: there a rolled-back transaction's rollback record can also make a transaction concurrent with it conflict; the embedded store does not emulate that (a spurious conflict, not a guarantee). Tests: the conformance case `locked_key_conflicts_with_later_writers` (both backends); embedded `gc_drops_old_locks_and_keeps_values_beneath`, `a_commit_started_below_the_safe_point_conflicts`, and the model check's reference counting committed locks; Live `locked_journal_heads_make_mutations_in_flight_rerun` (Task 8's mutated fence, now a parity test) and `journal_shard_change_fences_a_mutation_in_flight` (R1's `set_journal_shards` fence). | Backend parity (Review Focus 4): R1's `set_journal_shards` relies on it, and `loams-pg-control` and later fences may | A lock costs one small version per locked key until GC |

Task 9 (2026-10-12, stacked on Task 8 and on row T21-20).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T9-1 | **A journal fence instead of the mutation lifetime wait** (as T8-4). `RunnerOptions.max_mutation_lifetime` and the pre-prewrite TSO check (Ruling 9) are not built, so mutations pay no extra TSO fetch. An index is backfilled from the moment the fence after its `backfilling` commit returns, and a dropped index's entries are deleted once the fence after its `dropping` commit returns, with no `since + 2 × lifetime` wait. `mutation_older_than_lifetime_refuses_to_prewrite` is replaced by `index_change_fence_reruns_mutations_in_flight`. That test is a mutation that read the table before the deploy and commits after the backfill passed: it reruns, and it writes its own entry (without the fence it commits with no entry: `left: 1, right: 2`). `drop_index_deletes_entries_after_wait` keeps its name; its "wait" is the fence. | T8-4 made the fence exact on both backends; T21-20 made `lock_keys` fence on embedded too | None found: every writer of index entries is a journal-writing mutation or a job batch that locks its documents |
| T9-2 | **`IndexState` as built: `Backfilling { deployment }`, `Ready`, `Dropping`**. It is in `catalog::IndexDef.state`; `catalog.proto` adds `IndexDef.state` (enum `IndexState`; unspecified means ready, as in records written before Task 9) and `IndexDef.deployment`. There is no `WriteOnly { since }`, because there is no wait (T9-1). There is no checkpoint in the state either: the backfill's checkpoint, lease and progress are its `TableJob` record (kind `0x07`, job kind `TABLE_JOB_KIND_BACKFILL = 2`), as T8-5 built for validations. A table may hold a ready index and a backfilling index of the same name (a changed index). `TableDef::index_named` resolves a name to the ready one first, then a backfilling one, and never to a dropping one. Writes maintain ready and backfilling indexes (`docs::index_keys`) and skip dropping ones. | One job mechanism (T8-5); a state that a wait no longer needs is not kept | The plan's state names differ |
| T9-3 | **The fence runs after the change, as one transaction per shard, run concurrently** (`Journal::fence_after`). It is one small transaction per shard that `lock_keys` the shard's head: 32 attempts, in the runner's commit mode. The shards' transactions run together. Step 4's catalog transaction (enforcing validators, backfilling indexes, the record's state) no longer rewrites every head in itself, so it no longer conflicts with every concurrent append. That in-transaction fence made a deploy fail with `Conflict` under a steady write load on embedded (`concurrent_inserts_during_backfill_are_indexed`, the checker with `AddIndex`). Why it is correct: a mutation that read the catalog before the change either commits before its shard's fence (and so before any scan starts, which then sees it), or after it (and then conflicts and reruns past the change). `backfill::drop_indexes` fences the same way before it deletes, so the swap and `schema::release` need no fence. `Journal::fence` (the in-transaction rewrite) stays for callers that need it inside a transaction. | A busy app could not deploy | One extra transaction per shard (16 by default) per deploy that validates, backfills or drops |
| T9-4 | **The deploy path.** **Step 4** (`deploy::validate`) does two things in its transaction: `schema::enforce` (Task 8) and `schema::begin_backfills`. `begin_backfills` gives each existing table's added indexes the state `backfilling` for the deployment, taking over a backfilling index of the same name and fields left by another deploy. It creates a backfill job leased by the deploy. A table whose backfill job belongs to another deployment with a live lease is `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.<br>The record becomes `validating`, or `backfilling` with indexes only. After the fence, the validation jobs run first; then the record moves `validating → backfilling`, and the backfill jobs run (`TableJob` with `backfill::IndexBackfill`). Each batch locks its documents (`lock_keys`), then puts the entries of the deployment's backfilling indexes. A batch that still conflicts after the runner's attempts (writers keep touching its documents) is retried at half the size, down to one document; the job gives up after 16 such batches in a row, and a batch that goes through doubles the size back. This applies to every `TableJob`, Task 8's validations too. A janitor round deletes at most `JANITOR_DROP_KEYS` (100 000) dropped entries (`drop_indexes_within`); the post-swap task has no bound. `index_status` counts in pages of 4 096 (PR #457 review). A document whose entry would pass `max_index_key_bytes` is a finding, and findings fail the deploy (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`, listing up to 100 ids and the first document's reason).<br>**The swap** (`schema::apply`) does three things. It makes an added index ready only if it is backfilling for this deployment and this deployment's job is done; otherwise the swap is `FAILED_PRECONDITION` ("deploy again"). It deletes the job. It makes every maintained index that is not declared `dropping`.<br>**After a swap** that dropped an index, a detached task runs `backfill::drop_indexes`. That deletes the entries in batches of `JobOptions.batch` keys at `docs_per_s`, then removes the definition. The janitor (`deploy::retain`) runs it too (`Retained.indexes_removed`).<br>**Failures.** `deploy::fail` releases the deploy's backfills: its backfilling indexes become `dropping`, and its jobs are deleted. The janitor releases backfills whose deployment has no live job (liveness counts validation and backfill jobs together, as T8-7). It fails `backfilling` records with "…backfill jobs' leases expired…".<br>**Activation** (rollback) re-adds an index the earlier schema declares through the same step 4, without changing the record's state. `SchemaChanges` gains `indexes_added` and `indexes_dropped` (`schema::IndexChange { table, index }`); a dry run reports them. | §45 §3.3, §4.2; T8-6's reasoning | A rollback that re-adds an index backfills it before activating |
| T9-5 | **Reads.** Any read of an index range checks `TableDef::readable` first. A backfilling index is the new `LiveError::IndexNotReady`: `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_index_not_ready`, registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`, with the facade goldens and `facade.ts` regenerated. A dropping index is `NOT_FOUND`, as an unknown one is. `_system:tables` lists ready user indexes only, so its shape is unchanged (the desktop and web read it). `GetIndexStatus` is `backfill::index_status(runner, table, index) → IndexStatus { state, done, total_estimate }`, a Rust API until Task 10 puts it on `LiveAdminService`. `done` is the job's `scanned` (every document once ready). `total_estimate` counts the table's `by_creation_time` entries now. `loams-live-js`'s `withIndex` field check uses `index_named`. | No change to `_system:tables` consumers (do not edit `apps/desktop-electron/`, `web/`) | A client sees a backfilling index only through the status call |
| T9-6 | **R1 Ruling 5 and the row T9-1 quiesce gate are retired for deploys.** `Runner::try_quiesce`, `Quiesced` and the admission lock are deleted, and so is the `quiesce_refuses_in_flight_mutations_and_holds_new_ones` test. `try_quiesce_is_gone` checks `src/txn.rs`'s text: there is no public API snapshot to check against, and a missing method cannot be called. `catalog::define_table`, a direct catalog primitive with no backfill, keeps the empty-table rule. It also refuses a table with an index change in progress. | Brief | None |
| T9-7 | **Files and tests beyond the brief.**<br>Files: `catalog.rs` (`IndexState`, `readable`, `index_named`, `ready_indexes`, `put_table`), `schema.rs` (`IndexChange`, `Backfill`, `begin_backfills`, index planning and the swap, release), `deploy.rs`, `docs.rs` (`index_key`), `error.rs`, `journal.rs` (`fence_after`), `system.rs`, `testing/checker.rs`, `loams-live-js/src/host.rs`, `catalog.proto`, `docs/api/reasons.md`, the facade goldens and `facade.ts`.<br>The checker wires `AddIndex` (it deploys a schema with every table's `by_n` plus `by_n2`) and `DropIndex` (only `by_n`). After the run it deletes dropped indexes and checks that each table's index entries are exactly those its documents give (new `ViolationKind::Index`). `reactive_checker_reports_unwired_disturbances` now uses `IdentityChange`.<br>Task 7's `rollback_reapplies_previous_schema` is un-ignored and passes. `invalid_bundle_fails_without_pointer_change`'s catalog refusal is now a new index whose entry for an existing document is too large, since an index change is no longer refused.<br>The other SDKs' reason registries gain `live_index_not_ready` in the SDK owner's next sync (as T8-8). | Brief | None |

Task 10 (2026-10-12, stacked on Task 9).

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| T10-1 | **The proto as built** (`proto/loams/live/v1/admin.proto`, package `loams.live.v1`, Ruling 6). `LiveAdminService { Deploy; ListDeployments; GetDeployment; ActivateDeployment; GetIndexStatus; TailLogs }`, module `live.admin`, `unstable`. `DeployRequest` and `DeployResponse` move out of `live.proto`: the request keeps `bundle = 1` and `schema = 2` and gains `optional string expected_active = 3` (absent means "the app has no active deployment", row T6-3), `message = 4` and `dry_run = 5`; the response is `{ deployment, changes }`. The wire `Deployment` has string ids (ULIDs), the bundle hash as lowercase hex and `failure_reason`; `SchemaChanges` mirrors `schema::SchemaChanges`. **`DeploymentState` and `IndexState` move from `catalog.proto` to `admin.proto`** (same package, names and numbers), and `catalog.proto` imports `admin.proto`, so stored records decode unchanged and the TypeScript stubs get the enums without the internal catalog file. `ListDeployments` is AIP-158 (`page_size` 0 is 100, more than 1 000 is 1 000, negative is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`; `page_token` is the next page's `after` ULID). A malformed id is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`; an unknown one `NOT_FOUND`. | The plan names the RPCs only | None |
| T10-2 | **A deployment records its functions.** `GetDeployment` answers `{ deployment, schema, functions }`, where `functions` is `FunctionInfo { path, kind, visibility, args }` (kind and visibility enums, `args` the `Validator` message). `LoadedBundle::functions()` (default empty) hands them over at step 1, and the record keeps them sorted by path (`DeploymentRecord.functions`, catalog field 11), so any deployment's functions show without loading its bundle. A record written before Task 10 shows none. `deploy::get_deployment` is new. | The console's Deployments page lists a deployment's functions with their validators | One more field per record (a few KiB for a large bundle) |
| T10-3 | **The Live listener sits behind the engine's authentication layer** (`LOAMS_AUTH_MODE`, `crates/loams/src/auth`), both services, with no public paths. `LiveServer::start_guarded(config, runtime, guard, shutdown)` takes a `service::Guard` (a router wrapper); `start_with` is `start_guarded` without one. The server builds `Auth` once in `start_with_live`, before anything binds, and hands it to the node (`NodeSetup.auth`), so the main port and Live share one JWKS cache and one set of warnings. A small middleware turns the admitted `auth::Principal` into `loams_live::admin::Caller { id }` (its subject, never the credential), which the admin service records as `created_by`: `apikey:<id>` for an API key, `dev-loopback` with authentication off, and `deploy::UNAUTHENTICATED` for a `LiveServer` started without a guard (tests, embedders). With `LOAMS_AUTH_MODE=off` (the default) every request is admitted as `dev-loopback`, so the desktop and `loams dev` see no change (row T0-12). **Behaviour change:** with authentication on, Live's loopback listener now needs a credential too (before, any local process could call it, `Deploy` included); a Tailscale identity does not count there, since it is not the `tailscale serve` target. The main port registers `LiveAdminAbsent` (`feature_not_in_variant`) beside `LiveAbsent`, and the catalogue row lists `loams.live.v1.LiveAdminService`, until Task 12. Per-app authorization (`live:deploy`, `live:admin`, `logs`) is Task 15's. | The dispatch: the admin service sits behind the engine's auth like the other services; it deploys code | A script that called a loopback Live port with authentication on needs a key |
| T10-4 | **Function logs as built** (`crates/loams-live/src/logs.rs`). One `logs::Ring` per app per node, 10 000 lines (`RING_LINES`), owned by the app's `Runner` (`Runner::logs`), which the service and the subscription manager both hold. The callers record, since they know the request: `Query` and `Mutate` take a fresh ULID request id and answer it in the **`loams-request-id`** header (on errors too); a subscription's evaluation that wrote anything gets a ULID of its own. Request ids are never client-chosen (nothing a caller sends reaches a log line but the function's own output) and never the idempotency key. An entry is `{seq, ts_ms (wall clock at record), request_id, function, deployment (None for a built-in), level, line, truncated}`. A mutation records its committing attempt only; an idempotent replay records nothing. **Failed calls (the row T3-8 question):** their console lines stay lost (the runtime returns only the error); a call that ends with a function failure (`FUNCTION_ERROR`, including `live_worker_crashed`, `FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`, `FUNCTION_OUT_OF_MEMORY`) adds one `error` line with the error's text; any other failure adds nothing, because the caller's own mistakes are not the function's output and an internal error's text may name keys. A call past the per-call line limit adds a `warn` line counting the dropped lines. Every line and error text is cut to 4 KiB at a character boundary. No line ever goes to the server's own log. The ring is per app, so one app's lines never reach another app's tail. | §45 §3.3, D695; "no secrets and no user data in logs" | Failed calls' console output is lost until the runtime returns it with the error |
| T10-5 | **`TailLogs` as built.** `TailLogs{follow, since_ms?, function?}` streams `TailLogsResponse { entries (≤ 500, oldest first), skipped }` from the oldest line the ring holds; `skipped` counts lines the ring overwrote before the stream read them (a slow follower). `since_ms` compares the record time; `function` is an exact match. With `follow` the stream waits for new lines, sends an empty response every 15 s as a heartbeat (as `Watch`), and ends when the server stops; without it, it ends once caught up. Each node tails its own ring; merging nodes is Task 24's. Not durable (§45 §3.3). | §45 §3.3 | None |
| T10-6 | **Reflection on the Live listener.** `loams-live-proto` now emits its descriptor set (`FILE_DESCRIPTOR_SET`), and the Live listener installs `grpc.reflection.v1`, listing `LiveService` and `LiveAdminService` only (the internal files stay resolvable by name, as on the main port). It is always on: the listener is loopback-only and behind the auth layer. `live_service_has_no_deploy` asks it for `loams.live.v1.LiveService.Deploy` (not found) and `LiveAdminService.Deploy` (found), and checks the old path answers 404. | The brief's test reads "the reflection service" | None |
| T10-7 | **SDKs.** The facade regenerates: `loams.tables` loses `deploy`, and the new `loams.live.admin` module has `deploy`, `listDeployments` (paginated, retry-safe), `getDeployment` and `getIndexStatus` (retry-safe), `activateDeployment` and `tailLogs` (server stream). `@loams/live`'s `./live` export is now a barrel, `src/live.ts`, re-exporting `live_pb` and `admin_pb`, because the facade imports a package's types from one path (`package=loams.live.v1=@loams/live/live`); `index.ts` exports `admin_pb` too. The Rust SDK drops `TablesModule::deploy` (its keyed tests use `live.admin.deploy`); it has the generated `LiveAdminModule` trait and no hand-written module for it yet. **Follow-up for the SDK owner:** the committed Go, Python, C++, C#, Java and other stubs and hand-written modules still name `LiveService.Deploy`, which the server no longer routes; they regenerate at the next registry sync, as T8-8 noted for reasons. | The facade generates from the protos | A caller of the stale SDKs' `tables.deploy` gets `UNIMPLEMENTED` |
| T10-8 | **The console's Live plugin (`web/plugins/live`, not edited here) against the real proto.** It matches: deployment fields (`bundleSha256` hex, `createdAtMs`, `createdBy`, `message`, `parent`, `failureReason`, the seven states), `FunctionInfo { path, kind, visibility, args }`, the log line `{ ts, requestId, function, level, line, truncated }` and `TailLogs{ follow, sinceMs, function }`, and `live_deploy_conflict`. **Mismatches for the console owner:** (a) `workerHealth()` has no RPC (worker health is Task 27's metrics and debug dump); (b) `Deployment.rolledBackFrom` is not recorded, since a rollback writes no record (T7-1); (c) the mock refuses activating a `failed` deployment, the server allows it (T7-1); (d) the wire enums are `DEPLOYMENT_STATE_*`, `LOG_LEVEL_*`, `FUNCTION_KIND_*` and `FUNCTION_VISIBILITY_*`, and `args` is the `Validator` oneof, not `{ kind, … }`, so `createLiveAdminApi` maps them; (e) `TailLogs` yields batches with `skipped`, which the adapter flattens; (f) `listDeployments` is paginated; (g) each line also names its `deployment`. | The dispatch: match where sensible, note the rest | None |
| T10-9 | **Files and tests beyond the brief.** Files: `catalog.proto`, `crates/loams-live-proto/{build.rs,src/lib.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/src/{deploy.rs,subs.rs,txn.rs,lib.rs}`, `crates/loams-live-js/src/loader.rs`, `crates/loams/src/{server.rs,api/connect.rs,auth/mod.rs}`, `crates/loams/tests/{live.rs,live_dev.rs}`, `crates/loams-live/tests/deploy.rs`, `sdks/typescript/packages/live/{package.json,src/index.ts,src/live.ts}`, `sdks/typescript/packages/client/src/gen/facade.ts`, `sdks/rust/src/{client.rs,binding.rs,request.rs,facade.rs}`, the facade goldens, and §44 §7.2's module row. Tests added: `the_live_listener_sits_behind_the_auth_layer` (`crates/loams/tests/live.rs`: 401 `token_missing` on both services without a key, a deploy with one records `apikey:<id>` and never echoes the key); unit tests in `logs.rs` (filters, failures recorded or not, cutting and dropped lines), `admin.rs` (AIP-158 pages) and `deploy.rs` (records with functions round-trip). Changed: `errors_map_to_connect_codes` and `live_service_deploys_and_serves_functions` deploy over `LiveAdminService`; `dev_serves_deployed_functions` deploys over it and checks `createdBy` is `dev-loopback`. | Brief | None |
| T12-1 | **Task 12 runs before Task 11** (owner dispatch 2026-10-13: the console's Live deployments view needs `LiveAdminService` reachable over the tailnet, behind the engine's auth). The main port registers the running Live server's own services: `LiveHandle::routes()` hands out `loams_live::LiveRoutes` (the same `Live` and `Admin` instances, so one set of sessions, one engine, one log ring), which `start_with_live` passes to the node (`Prebuilt { auth, live }`, replacing the bare `auth` argument) and `api::live::register` puts on the connect router in place of `LiveAbsent`/`LiveAdminAbsent` (moved from `connect.rs` to `api/live.rs`). `CATALOGUE`'s `loams.live.v1` row is `available: cfg!(feature = "live")` and `Served.live` narrows it to "Live runs and this router serves it", for `GetInstance` and the static health registration alike. | The dispatch; Task 12 is the plan's mechanism for it | None |
| T12-2 | **Loopback until Task 18, kept.** Live is registered on the main port only when `--listen` is loopback, and always on the `tailscale serve` target (`LOAMS_TAILSCALE_LISTEN`, loopback by `validate_auth`, reached over the tailnet with the tailnet's TLS and identity). A non-loopback main port keeps `feature_not_in_variant` for the package (the start logs it once) rather than refusing to start, since the main port's own non-loopback rule (`check_listeners`) already allows it with auth on. The compose stack (`--listen 127.0.0.1:8080`, the sidecar on 7781) serves Live on both. | Global constraint "Loopback until Task 18"; the preview's only door is the tailnet | A deployment that binds `--listen` beyond loopback does not reach Live there until Task 18 |
| T12-3 | **The caller on the main port.** `api::live::caller` (moved from `server.rs`) runs inside the port's authentication layer on the connect routes when Live is served, so `created_by` is the admitted principal's subject on every door: `apikey:<id>`, the OIDC `sub`, `tailscale:<login>` on the serve target, `dev-loopback` with auth off. Per-app authorization stays Task 15's. | Task 10 records the deployer | None |
| T12-4 | **`--live-listen` deprecated, the listener kept.** Without the flag Live's own listener still binds `127.0.0.1:7710` (the desktop's protocol proxy routes `/loams.live.v1.` there, and the desktop passes `--live-listen`); naming the flag prints `loams: warning: --live-listen is deprecated; Live is served on --listen (D688)` on stderr. Follow-up for the desktop owner (AP1e): route `/loams.live.v1.` to the engine's main port and stop passing `--live-listen`; the warning shows in the desktop's engine log until then. Not built here: `_system:tables` (AP1e Task 20 merged it). Reflection on the main port lists the Live services (it did for the stubs) but resolves their files only on Live's own listener (`loams-proto`'s descriptor set has no `loams.live.v1`). | Plan Task 12; the desktop is not this plan's to edit | A desktop engine log line per start |
| T12-5 | **Tests as built** (`crates/loams/tests/live_connect.rs`): `live_on_main_port_over_connect_grpc_and_grpc_web` (deploy and query over Connect JSON on `--listen`, the same deployment answering on Live's own listener, `Query` over gRPC on HTTP/2 and gRPC-Web on HTTP/1.1), `get_instance_reports_live_available`, `live_absent_when_live_is_off` and `live_absent_without_feature` (a build without `live`), `live_on_main_port_sits_behind_the_auth_layer` (API keys: 401 `token_missing` on Deploy, ListDeployments, Query and Mutate without a key; `createdBy = apikey:<id>` with one), `live_over_the_tailnet_but_not_on_a_non_loopback_main_port` (T12-2: the serve target serves Live and records `tailscale:me@example.com`; a `0.0.0.0` main port answers `feature_not_in_variant` even with a key) and `live_listen_flag_warns_and_serves` (T12-4). | Brief, plus T12-2/T12-3 | None |
| T11-1 | **The proto as built** (`journal.proto`): `JournalEntry.catalog` is **`repeated CatalogChange catalog = 5`** (the plan wrote one), since one transaction can change several records (a deploy creates tables and activates). `CatalogChange { CatalogChangeKind kind; optional uint32 table_id; string deployment }`, kinds `TABLE_CREATED`, `INDEXES` (an index added, changing state or removed), `VALIDATOR`, `DEPLOYMENT_ACTIVATED` and `APP_SETTINGS`. The new types sit at the end of the file so existing descriptor indexes do not move. An entry needs a write **or** a catalog change; a catalog change rides in an entry's first chunk. The SDKs that commit `journal.proto`'s stubs are regenerated with their pinned templates (Go, C++, C#, Python with its `.pyi` from `protocolbuffers/pyi:v35.0`, Java) and `@loams/proto`. | One entry per transaction | None |
| T11-2 | **Who writes them.** `catalog::put_table` compares the record with the stored one and records `TABLE_CREATED`, `INDEXES` and `VALIDATOR` (rewriting a record unchanged records nothing); `create_table` and `define_table` write through it, so a table made by a first insert, by `define_table` or by a deployed schema, every index state change (backfill, ready, dropping, removed) and every validator change records one. The swap transaction (deploy and `activate`) records `DEPLOYMENT_ACTIVATED` with the deployment id, function `live.deploy.activate`; table changes use `live.catalog.table`. All go to **shard 0** (`catalog::CATALOG_SHARD`), so a transaction that changes several records writes one more journal head, not one per change. Nothing is recorded before the app's runner first opened (no journal). **Not recorded:** `set_journal_shards` (`APP_SETTINGS`): it runs only while the journal is empty and an entry would make it non-empty; `APP_SETTINGS` is for Task 13's `AppRecord`. | The plan's list | A catalog transaction can conflict on shard 0's head with a mutation and retry |
| T11-3 | **The reload at the tick.** The subscription manager of an engine (`spawn_for`) holds the `AppEngine`. A tick whose batch holds a `DEPLOYMENT_ACTIVATED` for a deployment the manager has not adopted calls the new `AppEngine::refresh_at(at)` (the pointer read at the tick's snapshot, served from that tick) and **does not acknowledge the batch**: the next tick adopts the deployment as Task 7 does and reads the batch again, so that tick's writes are matched, and every subscription reruns, on the new deployment. Entries already refreshed for are remembered by `(shard, seq)` until acknowledged, so a refresh whose pointer moved on, or that failed to load (logged; the janitor's refresh retries), never holds the ticks. A tick whose batch holds a table, index or validator change reruns every subscription once (publishing the changed ones). The writers' index keys already reflect their own catalog, so matching needs no catalog of its own. The janitor's 60 s refresh stays as a backstop. The backup exporter (Task 29) is not built. | §45 §9; the "within 60 s" gap of T6 | One more rerun of every subscription per table or index change |
| T11-4 | **Tests as built**, in `tests/deploy.rs` (its two-node helpers live there, not in `tests/journal.rs`): `catalog_entry_written_with_each_catalog_change` (a first insert's table, a schema's table, the activation, v2's index and validator, the rollback's activation), `tailer_reloads_catalog_at_the_tick` (node B, with no janitor, follows node A's deploy and rollback within seconds, no mixed Transition) and `data_write_after_index_change_in_same_tick_uses_new_catalog` (A adds `by_body` to a non-empty table and writes right after; B's v2 query over the new index ends equal to a fresh evaluation). All on the embedded store and, with `LOAMS_TEST_PD`, TiKV. | Brief | None |
| T13-1 | **The directory as built** (`crates/loams-live/src/apps.rs`). The system keyspace `loams_live_system` holds `0x00‖"next_id"` (u32), `0x00‖"changes"` (u64, bumped by every directory write, so directory writes serialize and nodes can poll it), `0x01‖id:u32 BE → AppRecord`, `0x02‖name → id` and `0x03‖id → AppIntent`. `AppRecord` (catalog.proto) wraps the wire `App` (admin.proto: `id, name, namespace, keyspace, state, purge_after_ms, limits, issuers, allowed_origins, allow_anonymous, created_at_ms`) plus `cursor_key_ref = "catalog"`: the cursor key stays the app's own catalog record (Task 4), so it is per app by construction. `AppLimits` holds optional overrides of six R1 limits that only tighten the server's (quotas join it in Task 28); `TrustedIssuer { issuer, audiences, jwks_uri? }` (§45 §5.3) is stored and checked (https or loopback, an audience) but verified only from Task 16. Names are not renamable in LV1 (bundle paths are by name). | Plan Task 13, §45 §7 | A rename later moves bundle paths |
| T13-2 | **Keyspace first, through an intent.** `Apps::create` allocates the id and writes an `AppIntent` naming `loams_live_a<id>` (refusing a taken name and a full cluster), ensures the keyspace (`StoreConfig::ensure_keyspace`: PD's `ensure_keyspace` on TiKV, nothing embedded), then one transaction re-checks, writes the record and the name and removes the intent. A failure after the keyspace leaves the intent: no record, the name stays free, and the directory janitor reports the keyspace as an orphan once the intent is older than 10 min (`orphan_after`); it never deletes it. `loams-tikv` gains `set_keyspace_state` (PUT `/pd/api/v2/keyspaces/<name>/state`), re-exported through `StoreConfig::set_keyspace_state`. | "a fault after `ensure_keyspace` leaves no record and an orphan the janitor reports" | An orphan keyspace stays until an operator removes it |
| T13-3 | **Layouts.** `LiveConfig.layout`: `Dedicated` (default; each name its own keyspace beside `--live-store`'s, embedded keyspaces in the same redb file) or `Rooted` (every name a root `base_root‖0xFE‖name‖0x00` in the base keyspace). `TestStore::live_config` uses `Rooted`, because a test cluster has only its fixed keyspaces; production never does. The server's own app keeps the keyspace it already used (`loams_live_<app>`, R1) through `Apps::adopt`, which writes its record on first start; `loams_live_system` is added to the PD `pre-alloc` lists, and the engine ensures it at start on TiKV anyway. | Test clusters; R1 data stays where it is | None |
| T13-4 | **Engines** (`crates/loams-live/src/engines.rs`). `Engines::resolve(header)` reads the record (cached per node, dropped when the change counter moves; polled every second), refuses a missing app (`NOT_FOUND`), a bad name (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) and a disabled or deleting one (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `live_app_disabled`), then starts the app's `AppRuntime` (store, runner with the app's limits, `AppEngine`, subscription manager, sessions, janitor) once, in a `OnceCell`. Every `LiveService` and `LiveAdminService` deployment call routes through it, so `ModifyQuerySet` and `TailLogs` need the same header as the session's `Watch`. The server's own app starts with the server and is never reaped (startup still fails fast on a broken store); others stop after `idle_after` (10 min) with no session, no request in flight (the runtime's `Arc` is unshared) and none since. A directory change stops engines whose app is no longer active or whose limits changed; they restart with the new limits on the next request (the server's own app keeps its start-time limits until restart). `LiveHandle::{store, stats, sessions}` report the server's own app. | Plan Task 13; §45 §7 "per-app engines" | A request racing the reaper can hold a stopped runtime for one call |
| T13-5 | **Deletion.** `DeleteApp` sets `Deleting { purge_after_ms = now + 7 days }` (`AppsOptions.retention`) and disables the keyspace in PD (TiKV); the server's own app cannot be deleted. The directory janitor (every janitor interval) deletes the app's keys below `0xFE` in batches of 512, archives its keyspace, removes its record and name (the name is reusable; the keyspace is not), and deletes its bundles. **TODO (Task 29):** a backup is taken before the deletion by default once backups exist; until then `DeleteApp` takes none. `APP_SETTINGS` journal entries (row T11-2) are not written: settings live in the system keyspace, and nodes follow them through the change counter, not an app's journal. | Plan Task 13 | Data deleted after 7 days with no backup until Task 29 |
| T13-6 | **Limits.** `max_apps_per_cluster` is `AppsOptions.max_apps`, default 1 000 (§45 §15 P14's expectation, until Task 33 measures it); the server's own app counts. Over it, `CreateApp` is `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (`LimitExceeded { limit: "max_apps_per_cluster" }`). A taken name is `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, reason `live_app_exists` (registered with `live_app_disabled` in `docs/api/reasons.md`). There is no CLI flag for either yet. | Plan Task 13 | None |
| T13-7 | **Tests as built** (`crates/loams-live/tests/apps.rs`, every one on both backends): `create_list_get_update_app` (Connect JSON, paging by 2), `create_app_creates_keyspace_first` (a `FaultPlan` refusing `live.apps.create`), `engine_starts_lazily_and_stops_when_idle` (a 300 ms `idle_after` in real time rather than paused time: the embedded store's committer thread and the runner's deadlines would see paused time jump), `two_apps_never_see_each_others_documents`, `disabled_app_refuses_calls`, `deleted_app_purged_after_retention` (the janitor at an explicit time) and `max_apps_per_cluster_enforced`. SDKs: the stubs and facades are regenerated for the five new RPCs; the hand-written Swift facade has no app calls yet (follow-up for the SDK owner). | Brief | None |
| T19-0 | **Task 19 runs before Tasks 14–18.** Task 14 (the verifier) needs an owner decision: the engine already verifies Loams sessions, OIDC tokens, API keys and tailnet users in `crates/loams/src/auth` (API2), and Live sits behind it (T10-3, T12-3), so the plan's separate `loams-auth` crate would duplicate it; Tasks 15–18 build on Task 14. Task 19 depends on none of them. | Burst brief: next unblocked task | None |
| T19-1 | **Reasons on the wire.** `LiveError::wire_reason` gives every Live error a reason: its own (`live_*`), else the generic reason of its code (`invalid_argument`, `not_found`, `failed_precondition`, `resource_exhausted`, `unavailable`, `internal`). New: `live_function_error`, `live_function_timeout`, `live_function_out_of_memory` and `live_limit_exceeded` (with `limit` in the metadata). `service::connect_error` attaches one `loams.errors.v1.ErrorInfo` (as the main port's own services do, via `loams-proto`) with the reason and, when there is one, `request_id`. Connect codes: a function's own error is `unknown` (the application's, not the server's), a CPU timeout `deadline_exceeded`, out of memory `resource_exhausted`, a worker crash stays `internal`. All are registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`, the conformance corpus and the hand-kept SDK registries. | Plan Task 19; §44 §7.4 | A client that branched on `internal` for a thrown function error now sees `unknown` |
| T19-2 | **Scrubbing.** An internal error (`Internal`, `Corrupt`, any `Txn`) reaches the client scrubbed (`error::scrub`: byte arrays of four or more bytes, runs of 16+ hex digits, and quoted strings with `\x` escapes become `…`), followed by `(request <id>)`; the scrubbed text and the id are logged at `warn`. The raw text is never logged either (Review Focus 6). Session results (`LiveError::to_proto`) are scrubbed the same way. `Query` and `Mutate` reuse their `loams-request-id`; other calls draw a new id. | Plan Task 19, §20 §11.4 | A message loses a long hex token that was not a key |
| T19-3 | **Size limits before decoding.** Per-route connect-rust limits: `LiveService` routes take a message of `MAX_ARGS_BYTES` (4 MiB) plus 1 MiB headroom for the rest of the request; `Deploy` takes `MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES` (16 MiB) plus 1 MiB for its schema (connect-rust's default was 4 MB for every route, so a bundle over 4 MB could not be deployed). The wire body may be twice the message, for JSON. Over the limit is `resource_exhausted` before the message is decoded. | Plan Task 19 | Arguments between 4 and 5 MiB pass |
| T19-4 | **Read timestamps at the edge.** `Query.ts` and a `Watch` resume's `last.ts` more than 1 s ahead of the store's clock (`physical_ms`) are `INVALID_ARGUMENT` on both backends before any snapshot. Tests (`tests/service.rs`): `future_read_ts_refused_at_the_edge` (`u64::MAX` and three years ahead; the clock does not jump), `tikv_errors_never_leak_raw_keys` (a `NotApplied` holding a key array, a `\x` string and a hex run; captured log and client message hold the request id and none of the key), `every_live_reason_is_registered`, `oversized_arguments_refused_before_decode` (also a 6 MB bundle passes the size check). | Plan Task 19, row T21-14 | None |
| T14-1 | **No `loams-auth` crate; Live adapts the engine's auth** (coordinator ruling, 2026-10-16, under the owner's "pick sensible defaults"; supersedes T0-3's plan to build the verification core). The engine already verifies console sessions, OIDC and Loams tokens (RS256/EdDSA, issuer, audience, `exp`/`nbf` with leeway, `none` and HS256 refused), argon2id API keys compared in constant time with revocation, and tailnet users (`crates/loams/src/auth`, API2), and Live sits behind that layer on both doors (T10-3, T12-3). The plan's verifier tests map to the auth module's: `valid_loams_token_verifies`, `expired_rejected_with_60s_leeway`, `wrong_issuer_rejected`, `alg_none_and_hs256_rejected` and `tampered_payload_rejected` are the cases of `oidc_tokens_are_verified_against_the_issuer` (`tests/auth.rs`); `api_key_verifies_and_hash_compare_is_constant_time` and `revoked_key_rejected_within_cache_ttl` are `api_key.rs`'s `ct_eq` path and `directory.rs`'s revocation check. No issuance, no new key store. | Two verification cores would drift | MT1 may still move the core into a crate; Live reads only `Caller` |
| T14-2 | **The principal's grant, additive.** `auth::Principal` gains `grant: Grant { org, environment, scopes, expires_at_ms }`, each `Option`, `None` meaning the self-hosted default (the install's one org and environment, every scope). Filled where the source names it: OIDC/Loams tokens from `org`, `env`, `scp` (a list or a string) or `scope`, and `exp`; `KeyService` keys from the org, `<project>/<environment>`, their scopes (none listed: every scope) and expiry; console sessions from the org and the session's expiry. Key-file keys, tailnet users and dev loopback keep the default (tailnet tags are not read: `tailscale serve` passes none). Tests: `claims_fill_the_grant` (oidc.rs), `key_grants_name_the_environment_and_scopes` (directory.rs). Other callers of `Principal` are unchanged. | Coordinator ruling | Until MT1/API2 issue env-bound tokens, only `KeyService` keys and tokens carrying `env` are fenced |
| T14-3 | **Live's `Caller`** moves to `loams_live::auth` (re-exported from `admin`) and grows `kind` (`CallerKind`), `org`, `environment`, `scopes` and `expires_at_ms`. `api::live::live_caller` fills it from the admitted principal (test `the_live_caller_carries_the_grant`). A request without one (a bare Live server, as the crate's tests start) is `Caller::unauthenticated()`. | Plan Task 14's `Verified` | None |
| T15-1 | **The app fence as built** (`crates/loams-live/src/authz.rs`, `Engines::resolve_as`). A `Caller` bound to an environment reaches only the app whose `namespace` is that environment (`<project>/<environment>`, row T14-2); any other is Connect `PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `live_app_mismatch`, checked from the directory record **before** the app's engine starts. Without the `loams-live-app` header such a caller addresses the app of its environment (`Apps::find_by_namespace`, a directory scan; `NOT_FOUND` when none), else the server's own app. A caller bound to no environment (the self-hosted default) reaches every app. Creating and listing apps needs a caller bound to no environment (`live_app_mismatch` otherwise). Live's own `pb::ErrorCode` has no permission code, so in-protocol results carry `FAILED_PRECONDITION`; the refusal is at the call, before any session result exists. | §45 §6.2 | A `.proto` code later if per-query refusals are wanted |
| T15-2 | **Scopes and actions.** `Action` (`live:call`, `live:read`, `live:write`, `live:deploy`, `live:admin`) on `Resource` (`live_apps`, `live_app:<app>`, `live_table:<app>/<table>`), through `authz::Authorizer::check(caller, action, resource)` (the D66 shape; the engine's org-role authorizer is the console's, so Live has its own, `ScopeAuthorizer`; no static role-binding config is built). A deployed function is `call` (internal ones also need a platform principal, which every caller is until Task 16); `_system:*` queries are `read`, mutations `write`, of the table they name (`_system:query`, `_system:insert`), or of the app when addressed by id (`_system:get/patch/replace/delete`) or `_system:tables`; `live:read:<table>` / `live:write:<table>` allow one table. Every `LiveAdminService` deployment call is `deploy`; app directory calls are `admin`. `Watch` and `ModifyQuerySet` check every added query. A credential naming no scopes has all. A refusal is `PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `permission_denied`. | §45 §5.2 | Table grants do not cover id-addressed system calls |
| T15-3 | **Audit lines** (`audit = true`, `tracing::info!` with caller, kind, action, resource, what) for deploys (not dry runs), activations, app create/update/delete and every `_system:*` write, until the engine has an `_audit` log. | Plan Task 15 | None |
| T15-4 | **Tests as built** (`crates/loams-live/tests/authz.rs`, a test guard standing in for the engine layer): `authz_matrix` (caller kind {none, user, session, api_key} × scopes {all, call, read, write, read:notes, deploy, admin} × app {unbound, same, other} × 9 targets: public query, public mutation, internal query, `_system:query`, `_system:get`, `Watch _system:query`, `_system:insert`, a dry-run Deploy, UpdateApp; 576 rows in `authz_matrix.expected.md`, blessed with `LOAMS_BLESS=1` and read by hand against §45 §5), `other_app_credential_denied`, `table_level_read_grant_limits_system_query`, `audit_line_for_deploy_and_system_write`. End users, service accounts and agents are not callers yet (Task 16, MT1); they join the matrix then. `live_app_mismatch` is registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`, the corpus and every SDK registry (98). | Brief | None |
| T16-1 | **Classification as built** (§45 §5.3). The engine's layer (`crates/loams/src/auth/layer.rs`) lets a `LiveService` call through without a principal, marked `LeftToApp`, on a router that serves Live (`AuthLayerState::leaving_to_apps`: Live's own listener, the `tailscale serve` target, and a loopback main port; a router answering `feature_not_in_variant` for Live refuses as before), when it cannot admit it only because it has no credential or carries a JWT refused as `token_wrong_issuer`, `token_wrong_audience` or `credential_not_accepted` (`APP_END_USER_PATHS`); `api::live::caller` makes it `Caller::anonymous()`. In the app, `auth::identify` (from `Engines::resolve_as`, against the directory's current record, before the engine starts): a principal the engine admitted stays a platform principal (so the instance issuer's tokens, API keys and sessions are never end users); an anonymous call becomes the end user its bearer names (any failure `UNAUTHENTICATED` with the engine's reason) or, with no bearer, stays anonymous only when `allow_anonymous` (else `token_missing`); the developer on loopback and a bare server's caller become an end user only when the bearer's `iss` is one of the app's issuers (so `ctx.auth` works in `loams dev`). An expired or forged token of the engine's own issuer, a bad API key and `LiveAdminService` stay the engine's to refuse; `ScopeAuthorizer` also refuses end users and anonymous callers every action but `call` (a second check), and internal functions need a platform principal. No new reasons: the engine's `token_*` and `auth_unavailable` are reused (added to `LIVE_REASONS`), so the SDK registries are unchanged. A `LiveService` call without a credential on an authenticated engine is now Live's refusal: 401 with `ErrorInfo.reason = token_missing`, not the layer's `loams-auth-reason` header. `allow_anonymous` stays `false` for new and adopted apps; `loams dev` runs with auth off, where every caller is the developer. | §45 §5.3; T14-1 (Live adapts the engine's auth) | A client that read `loams-auth-reason` on `LiveService` reads `ErrorInfo` instead |
| T16-2 | **The end-user verifier lives in `loams-live`** (`auth::EndUsers`), not in the engine's `oidc` module, which `loams-live` cannot depend on; it follows the engine's rules (RS256 or EdDSA with the key's family, `iss`/`aud`/`exp`/`sub` required, `nbf` checked, discovery's `issuer` must match, `jwks_uri` https or loopback, no redirects, a failed refresh keeps the cached keys) with §45 §5.4's 60 s leeway, and an issuer's `aud` from its `TrustedIssuer.audiences`. Keys are shared per (issuer, `jwks_uri`) by every app that trusts it, cached 10 min (`JWKS_TTL`) and fetched for an unknown `kid` at most every 30 s (`JWKS_MIN_REFETCH`); a failed fetch is not repeated within that interval either (with no keys cached, `auth_unavailable` until then; PR #687 review). `TrustedIssuer`'s https-or-loopback check now parses the host (`http://localhost.evil.example` was accepted). | MT1 Task 2 has not merged | Two copies of the JWKS cache until MT1 moves them into one crate |
| T16-3 | **`Identity` and `ctx.auth`.** `Identity { issuer, subject, token_identifier = "<iss>\|<sub>", email, name, claims }` (`txn.rs`, replacing the T4-1 uninhabited enum); `claims` is every claim as a `LiveValue` with JSON numbers as doubles (JavaScript numbers); `email` and `name` are the claims as given (the function reads `email_verified` from `claims` if it cares). It rides `CallCtx.identity` through `Runner::{query_as, mutate_as}` (the old `query`/`mutate` run with none), and the worker protocol's `CallContext.identity = 5`. `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` is async, as in Convex, and resolves to a frozen object or `null`. An end user's idempotency record digests the arguments with the issuer and subject, each length-prefixed (`tokenIdentifier` joins them with `\|`, which either may contain; PR #687 review), so a key never replays one user's result to another. | Plan Task 16; §45 §3.2 | None |
| T16-4 | **`Watch` runs without the end user's identity until Task 17.** End users may `Watch` public functions, but the subscriptions' queries see `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` as `null`: `SubKey` has no identity yet, so running them as the user would share one user's result with another (Review Focus 2). Task 17 adds the identity to `SubKey` and `Authenticate`. | Correctness first (§45 §5.4) | A reactive query that reads `ctx.auth` sees no user until Task 17 |
| T16-5 | **No `identity` workflow.** MT1's identity job does not exist, so `oidc_end_user_e2e` is an ordinary suite case that skips unless `LOAMS_TEST_OIDC_ISSUER`, `LOAMS_TEST_OIDC_AUDIENCE` and `LOAMS_TEST_OIDC_TOKEN` name an issuer (the `deploy/release/auth` stack, Zitadel after IA1), the app's client id and a fresh token. Follow-up for IA1 (which supersedes MT1, §76 D1600): run it in its job. | Plan Task 16 ("skipped where the stack is absent") | Not run in CI until IA1's job |
| T16-6 | **Tests as built.** `crates/loams-live/tests/identity.rs` (both backends; a stand-in issuer in `tests/support/oidc.rs` serving discovery and a swappable Ed25519 JWKS): `end_user_token_from_configured_issuer_calls_public_function`, `end_user_cannot_call_internal_or_system_or_admin` (also with a token naming every Live scope, and as the developer), `token_from_unconfigured_issuer_rejected` (another issuer, audience, expired, forged signature), `ctx_auth_returns_identity_claims` (anonymous-marked, developer and bare-server callers with the token; `null` for an API key and anonymous), `anonymous_allowed_only_when_configured`, `jwks_refresh_rate_limited` (`EndUsers::with_timing`, counting JWKS fetches across a key rotation), `jwks_fetch_failures_are_rate_limited_too`, `oidc_end_user_e2e`. `authz_matrix` gains 27 rows (an end user, an end user whose token names every Live scope, and an anonymous call, × the 9 targets; 603 in all). `loams-live-js`: `ctx_auth_in_isolated_workers`. Engine: `app_end_users_reach_live_through_the_engine_layer` (`live_connect.rs`, API-key mode), `only_live_service_calls_without_an_engine_credential_go_to_the_app` (layer unit test); `live_on_main_port_sits_behind_the_auth_layer`, `the_live_listener_sits_behind_the_auth_layer` and `every_served_rpc_requires_auth_except_allowlist` (`connect_auth.rs`, where Live is served) now expect Live's own `token_missing` on `LiveService`. | Brief | None |
| T18-0 | **Task 18 runs before Task 24** (Task 17 is another agent's, PR #693). Task 24 forwards `Authenticate`, which Task 17 adds, so it waits for Task 17; Task 18 depends on none of 17's work. | Dispatch: the next independent task in plan order | None |
| T18-1 | **`[tls]` is `LOAMS_TLS_*`** (`crates/loams/src/tls.rs`), read beside `LOAMS_AUTH_*` (the engine has no TOML config; `[auth]` is `LOAMS_AUTH_MODE` and its variables): `LOAMS_TLS_CERT_FILE` + `LOAMS_TLS_KEY_FILE` (PEM; rustls with ring, ALPN `h2` and `http/1.1`), `LOAMS_TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE` (optional mTLS, `WebPkiClientVerifier`), `LOAMS_TLS_TERMINATED_BY_PROXY=true` with `LOAMS_TLS_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (addresses or CIDR blocks). The settings must fit together (a cert with its key; a client CA only with a cert; a proxy with its addresses and no cert), or the start fails naming the variable. `MainListener` (an `axum::serve::Listener`) serves `--listen`: handshakes run in a `JoinSet` beside accept (10 s timeout, at most 1 024 in flight), and with a proxy a peer outside the trusted blocks is closed at accept. Dev and standalone only; a cluster node with any `LOAMS_TLS_*` refuses to start. MT1 Task 7 has not merged, so this is the port's TLS; MT1 extends it. | MT1 Task 7 unmerged; the plan's fallback | A TOML `[tls]` later maps onto the same struct |
| T18-2 | **The non-loopback rule applies where Live is served.** `ServerConfig::validate`: Live on a non-loopback `--listen` without (`tls.secures()` and auth on) is `--listen listen on <addr>: non-loopback addresses need [tls] and [auth] (MT1)`, followed by what to set or `--no-live`. Without Live the main port's rule is unchanged (`check_listeners`: non-loopback needs auth), so existing non-Live deployments keep starting; applying the TLS half to every service is MT1 Task 7's. T12-2's `feature_not_in_variant` fallback stays only as a router guard (`main_port_serves_live`). R1's `check_listen` refusal stays on `--live-listen` only. | §45 §6.1 says startup fails; narrowing it to Live avoids breaking deployments that bind beyond loopback for other services | An engine that served other services on `0.0.0.0` with auth and Live on by default now refuses until it sets TLS or `--no-live` (CHANGELOG "Changed") |
| T18-3 | **CORS as built.** The engine's layer (`auth/layer.rs`) answers a preflight on `LiveService` for its own origins (`LOAMS_CORS_ORIGINS`, or any with auth on and none listed) **and** the union of the active apps' `allowed_origins` (`loams_live::AppOrigins`, kept by `Engines` from the directory: at start, on every directory change, and right after this node's CreateApp/UpdateApp/DeleteApp); `LiveAdminService` and every other service keep the engine's origins only. The actual request is checked in Live (`origins::check`, from `service::app_of`, against the app's current record): an `Origin` the addressed app lists passes; so does a platform principal on an origin the engine allows (the layer marks it `EngineOrigin`, `api::live::caller` turns it into `loams_live::ConsoleOrigin`), so the console keeps working on every app; anything else is `PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `live_origin_not_allowed` (registered: reasons.md, corpus, every SDK registry, Swift included; 99). The refusal still carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for an app-listed origin so the page can read it. `Allow-Credentials` is never sent. `loams-live-app` and `loams-request-id` join the allowed request headers. The `tailscale serve` target keeps its strict CORS (ambient identity): app origins are not added there. | §45 §6.4 | An app's browser users cannot use the tailnet serve target; they use the main port |
| T18-4 | **Tests as built.** `crates/loams/tests/live_exposure.rs`: `non_loopback_without_tls_and_auth_refused` (no TLS with API keys; TLS with auth off; `--no-live` starts), `non_loopback_with_tls_and_auth_starts` (an rcgen certificate; GetInstance, Deploy and Query over HTTPS, HTTP/2 by ALPN; plain HTTP not served), `terminated_by_proxy_takes_trusted_peers_only` (trusted 127.0.0.0/8 served, 10.0.0.0/8 closed), `cors_preflight_allows_union_of_origins`, `cors_actual_request_checked_per_app` (also an UpdateApp reaching the check), `no_allow_credentials_header`. Unit tests: `tls::tests` (CIDR blocks, the variables, a missing file named), `origins::tests`. `live_connect.rs`'s `live_over_the_tailnet_but_not_on_a_non_loopback_main_port` becomes `live_over_the_tailnet` (the refusal moved to `live_exposure.rs`). | Brief | None |
| T17-1 | **Session identity as built** (`session.rs`, §45 §5.4). A session runs as the `Caller` of its `Watch` (`Sessions::open_as`, identified in the app as Task 16 does). `SubKey` gains `identity`, `Caller::subscription_key()`: `end_user:<issuer length>:<issuer><subject>` (unambiguous where `tokenIdentifier`'s `\|` is not), `principal:<id>` or `anonymous`; subscriptions carry the end user's `Identity` to `Runner::query_as`, so `ctx.auth` now works in `Watch` (lifting T16-4) and two callers never share a result. A resumed session keeps the client's identity version. | Plan Task 17 | Sharing across platform principals is lost (Q632) |
| T17-2 | **`Authenticate{session_id}`** (`live.proto`, `AuthenticateResponse.identity`) identifies its own `Authorization` in the session's app; the caller is first authorized for every query of the session (Task 15's `check_call`; a refusal changes nothing; also for the same caller, whose refreshed token may carry narrower scopes, PR #693 review); the same `subscription_key` then only moves the expiry (no rerun, same identity version); for another caller every query is resubscribed as it and one Transition carries every result at `identity + 1`. A credential that does not verify is refused and changes nothing; signing out is an `Authenticate` with no credential, admitted only where the app takes anonymous calls. An unknown session is `NOT_FOUND` (forwarding to another node is Task 24). | Plan Task 17 | None |
| T17-3 | **Expiry, revocation, rotation.** Expiry is the caller's `expires_at_ms` plus `SessionConfig::expiry_leeway` (60 s), on the runtime's clock: `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `token_expired`. Revocation: `LiveRoutes::revoke(principal)` closes the sessions running as it in every app on the node (`token_revoked`); the engine calls it from the directory's audit stream for `api_key.revoke` (`apikey:<id>`) and `member.remove` (the user id), so the latency is this node's (another node's sessions close at expiry or rotation until a cluster-wide feed exists). Rotation: `SessionConfig::max_age` (24 h) closes the stream with `UNAVAILABLE`, reason `session_rotate` (new: registered in `docs/api/reasons.md`, the corpus and every SDK registry, Swift included; 100). | Plan Task 17; Q637 | Cross-node revocation waits for MT1's feed |
| T17-4 | **Tests as built** (`tests/identity.rs`, both backends): `authenticate_same_subject_extends_without_rerun` (the app's `reruns` counter unchanged), `authenticate_new_subject_bumps_identity_and_reruns` (ada, bob, then signed out; a bad token and an unknown session refused), `expired_session_closed_with_token_expired` (a token past its `exp` within the verifier's leeway, a 200 ms session leeway, real time), `revoked_key_closes_sessions`, `stream_rotates_after_24h` (a 400 ms `max_age`; the default asserted), `results_never_shared_across_identities` (two subscriptions for one query), `authenticate_rechecks_a_refreshed_credential` (`tests/authz.rs`), and `reactive_checker_with_identity_changes` (two `IdentityChange`s over 3 sessions; `IdentityChange` is wired, `reactive_checker_reports_unwired_disturbances` now uses `NodeKill`). Real time rather than paused time, as T13-7: the embedded committer and the runner's deadlines would see paused time jump. | Brief | None |
| T24-1 | **No cluster listener: nodes forward over their Live endpoint with the caller's own credential.** Live refuses the engine's `--cluster` mode (dev and standalone only, R1), and the engine's internal listener is unauthenticated (overview §6.9), so a Live cluster is several standalone engines on one store, and `crates/loams/src/api/internal.rs` is not used. Each node registers in the system keyspace (`0x04‖node → NodeRecord`, JSON: `url`, `incarnation`, `authenticated`, `heartbeat_ms` on the store's clock; not a directory write, so the change counter does not move), refreshed every 2 s, fresh for 10 s (`ForwardConfig`). A `ModifyQuerySet` or `Authenticate` whose session id (`<node>-<32 hex>`, `forward::owner_of`) names another node is posted to that node's `LiveService` (Connect, binary) with the client's `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `loams-live-app` and `Origin` and `loams-live-forwarded: <node>`; the owner authenticates and authorizes it itself, and answers a forwarded call from its own sessions only. A node whose port authenticates never forwards to one that does not (`NodeRecord.authenticated`, from the engine's auth mode), so a forward cannot turn an anonymous call into a loopback developer's. The owner's Connect error is relayed as it is. | Plan Task 24, §45 §9; the plan's "cluster-token or mTLS" listener does not exist for Live | A tailnet identity (ambient, per connection) does not survive a forward; such callers get `session_gone` semantics only if the owner refuses them |
| T24-2 | **`session_gone` and `node_draining`** (new reasons; reasons.md, the corpus fixture and every SDK registry, Swift included; 102). `session_gone` (`NOT_FOUND`): the owner is unregistered, stale, unreachable, answers as no Live node, or no longer holds the session; a session id that names no node; a forwarded call for a session this node does not hold; also a local unknown session (previously the generic `not_found`). `node_draining` (`UNAVAILABLE`). | Plan Task 24 | A client that matched `not_found` text for unknown sessions sees the same code with a new reason |
| T24-3 | **Node ids and URLs.** `--live-node` (default `1`; 1–64 of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`) and `--live-advertise` (default `http://<Live's own listener>`, which only a node on the same host reaches; production sets the node's main-port URL). A node registering under an id whose record is still fresh at another URL takes it over and logs a warning (a restart after a crash on a new port, as `data_survives_sigkill_on_embedded` does; or a misconfigured second node with the same id, which the warning names). | Refusing would block a crash restart for up to the TTL | Two nodes given one id take each other's calls until an operator fixes it |
| T24-4 | **Draining** (`LiveHandle::drain`, called first by `stop`, so on `SIGTERM` via `Server::shutdown`): `LiveRoutes::draining()` turns true and the engine's `/ready` answers 503; the heartbeat stops and the record is removed; every session of every app closes with `node_draining` (`Sessions::close_all`, which also refuses sessions opened after it); every new `LiveService` call is refused with it; then up to 10 s (`drain_grace`) for in-flight mutations, counted from before their admission check. There is no delay between readiness and closing the streams. The `Mutate` session hint (`loam-session-id`) for a session on another node is not forwarded: the owner's session reaches the commit at its next tick. | Plan Task 24, §45 §9 | A load balancer that polls readiness slowly still routes a few calls to the draining node; they get `node_draining` and retry |
| T24-5 | **Tests as built.** `crates/loams-live/tests/multinode.rs` (two `LiveServer`s on one store, both backends, a test guard reading `Bearer user:<id>`): `modify_on_other_node_is_forwarded`, `authenticate_on_other_node_is_forwarded`, `dead_owner_gives_session_gone` (stopped, dead with a fresh record, stale record, unknown node, no node, not open, already forwarded), `a_node_id_in_use_is_taken_over`, `deploy_on_one_node_reaches_the_other_at_the_same_tick` (every version-1 result on either node older than every version-2 one), `drain_closes_streams_with_node_draining`. The reactive checker wires `NodeKill` (two nodes over one engine; the first dies, every client resumes on the second): `reactive_checker_with_node_kill`; every disturbance is now wired, so `reactive_checker_reports_unwired_disturbances` checks a second `NodeKill` (the checker runs two nodes) and one past the last op. Unit tests in `forward.rs`. | Brief | None |
