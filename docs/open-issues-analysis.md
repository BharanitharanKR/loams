---

## 3. Track 2: Tooling, Upstream & Operations (6 issues)

#### Issue #375: `[tooling] check-decision-ids.sh does not resolve citations against the log, and passes an empty log`
- **Goal**: Fix script `scripts/docs/check-decision-ids.sh` to validate citations across the repository against `docs/design/13-decision-log.md`.
- **Identified Bugs**:
  1. The script exits 0 when given an empty decision log file.
  2. It does not verify that `D<number>` references in source code actually correspond to existing rows in the decision log.
  3. Identified dangling citations: `D000`, `D055`, `D730`, `D742`, `D788`.
- **Readiness**: **Ready to implement immediately** (self-contained shell/python scripting task).

#### Issue #314: `[OWNER] Configure Cloudflare console production secrets and API origin`
- **Goal**: Add Cloudflare production secrets (`LOAMS_API_ORIGIN`, API tokens) for `console.loams.dev`.
- **Status**: **Blocked on Owner**. Deployment code is already merged via PR #301 (`origin/console-cf-deploy`).

#### Issue #253: `[OPS] Code signing with SignPath (free for OSS) for desktop, CLI and mobile release artifacts`
- **Goal**: Integrate SignPath for signing Windows and macOS binaries without proprietary hardware tokens.
- **Status**: Plan documented. Awaiting release packaging pipelines.

#### Issue #237: `Tracking: implementation backlog (Codex implements, Opus reviews)`
- **Goal**: Master operational tracking issue that coordinates all plan tasks, rulesets, and code review criteria.

#### Issue #148: `loams-wal: TLS on the Postgres and HTTP listeners`

#### Issue #118: `Track WeSQL upstream fixes (fork: ostrium-labs/wesql)`
- **Goal**: Upstream monitoring issue tracking sync status between `ostrium-labs/wesql` fork and upstream WeSQL.

---

## 4. Track 3: Core Storage, Metastore, Query & Routing (10 issues)

#### Issue #201: `[R] R1 — TiKV Metastore and the Reactive Core Implementation Plan`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-09-27-r1-reactive-core.md`
- **Goal**: Implement TiKV client layer (`loams-tikv`) and reactive metastore core.
- **Current State**:
  - Tasks 0–17 merged into `dev`, except Task 14 (the TypeScript reactive client) and Task 16 (the gates and the exit report), which are branch-only.
  - Verified 2026-10-07 by content, not by commit hash — see [`tracks-1-3-audit.md`](tracks-1-3-audit.md). Task 12's commits are on `dev` renamed `operon:`→`loams:`, so `git cherry` wrongly reports them missing.
  - The branch inventory below was wrong: `r1-t16` and `r1-t17` are byte-identical to `r1-t14` (stale pointers from GitHub PR merges, not separate work), and `r1-t15` never existed because Task 15 is already merged. The real remainder is **one** branch, `origin/r1-t14`.
- **Action**: Merge `origin/r1-t14` — but **after** API1, because `crates/loams/src/server.rs` is both the worst conflict (16 regions) and API1's server wiring.

#### Issue #202: `[D] D1 — Embedded Durable Execution, the Operations API and Bulk Import`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-09-27-d1-durable-execution.md`
- **Goal**: Embedded Resonate engine inside `loams-durable`, operations API, and bulk import workers.
- **Current State**:
  - Tasks 0–5 merged into `dev`.
  - Tasks 6–9 on feature branches: `origin/d1-t6`, `origin/d1-t7`, `origin/d1-t8`, `origin/d1-t9`. Note `d1-t8` is byte-identical to `d1-t7`.
  - **`origin/d1-t9`'s tip commit is `wip: D1 Task 9, in progress`** (verified 2026-10-07). This is unfinished work; merging it as-is would land a WIP commit as Task 9.
- **Action**: Finish Task 9 on the branch, then merge the stack (stacked after R1: `ci.yml`, `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` conflict in both).

#### Issue #207: `[RT] RT1 — Postgres Single-Shard Slice and the Deterministic Simulator`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-10-01-rt1-postgres-slice-and-sim.md`
- **Goal**: Single-shard routing contract for sharded Postgres and deterministic simulator in `crates/loams-sim`.
- **Status**: **Complete** (verified 2026-10-07). `origin/rt1-t0` is an ancestor of `dev`; `crates/loams-sim` and `crates/loams-sqlrouter` are present. RT0 foundations landed in #311.

#### Issue #208: `[RT] RT2 — Scatter, Merge and Aggregate with the Lean Oracle, Postgres 2PC and the Change Stream`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-10-01-rt2-scatter-oracle-2pc.md`
- **Goal**: Lean formal verification kernels for k-way merge, Postgres 2-Phase Commit (2PC), and change data streaming.
- **Status**: Was blocked on RT1, which is now **merged** (see #207), so this blocker is stale and RT2 can proceed.

#### Issue #209: `[FL] FL1 — Event Fabric Foundation (Iggy, Fluss, the Envelope and the Bridges)`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-10-01-fl1-fabric-foundation.md`
- **Goal**: Stand up the Event Fabric using Iggy / Fluss message broker engines with standardized CloudEvents envelopes.
- **Status**: Not started.

#### Issue #210: `[FL] FL2 — Loams House SQL Phase 1 (chDB, ClickHouse HTTP, Tier 1 Engines)`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-10-01-fl2-house-sql.md`
- **Goal**: Embed chDB ClickHouse SQL engine and expose ClickHouse HTTP interface.
- **Status**: **Complete** (verified 2026-10-07). Both `origin/fl2-t0-chdb-spike` and `origin/fl2-t3-errors` are ancestors of `dev`; `deploy/tikv/tidb.toml` is present. There is nothing left to integrate.

#### Issue #274: `[FL] FL3 — External Iceberg REST Catalog (R2 Data Catalog)`
- **Goal**: Read/write external Apache Iceberg tables backed by Cloudflare R2 Data Catalog inside `loams-iceberg`.
- **Status**: Design complete (§42 §6).

#### Issue #200: `[PG] PG1 — Postgres Wire Access over Collections`
- **Plan**: `docs/plans/2026-09-28-pg1-postgres-wire.md`
- **Goal**: Provide native Postgres wire protocol compatibility over Loams collections using `datafusion-postgres`.
- **Status**: Spike branch `origin/spike-pgwire` merged. Implementation pending.

#### Issue #198: `[M1] M1.6 — SDKs and MCP Server Implementation Plan`
- **Goal**: Original M1.6 plan for Python/TS SDKs and stdio MCP server.
- **Status**: Partially superseded by SDK1/SDK2 and CLI1; the MCP server tools (`search`, `sql`, `memory_write`, `list_collections`, `get_documents`) remain to be unified.

#### Issue #199: `[M1] M1.7 — M1 Exit Gates Implementation Plan`
- **Goal**: End-to-end exit gate validation for Milestone 1 collections, storage, and search.
- **Status**: Awaits resolution of remaining M1 tasks.
