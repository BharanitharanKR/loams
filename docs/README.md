# Loams documentation

Don't rent a cloud. Loam it. Build, understand, and contribute to Loams: open-source tooling for building software with agents, on ground you own, with hybrid retrieval on object storage, reactive data and durable execution underneath. Free and open source; runs on ground you own.

## Read status in context

The code and [feature status table](release/preview.md#feature-status) describe current implementation. Design documents explain intended behavior; plans and reviews are dated snapshots and may describe work that has since landed. A proposal is not a shipped feature. Loams is at 0.x (0.1.0): APIs and on-disk formats may change between minor versions; verify flags with the binary from your checkout and keep the selected source ref with any deployment instructions.

The public site at [loams.dev/docs](https://loams.dev/docs) combines reader guides with generated copies of `docs/design`. Update design originals here; the website syncs them with `LOAMS_REPO`, `LOAMS_REF`, or `LOAMS_DESIGN_DIR`.

Use **Loams** in prose, `loams` for the binary, `loams-*` / `loams_*` for Rust crates and paths, `@loams/*` for npm packages, and `loams.*.v1` for protobuf packages. Keep examples aligned with actual source paths and distinguish unpublished packages from installable releases.
