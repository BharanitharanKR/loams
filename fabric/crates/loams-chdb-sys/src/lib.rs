//! Loams's own FFI over `libchdb`: the `bindgen` declarations of the pinned
//! `chdb.h`, and nothing else.
//!
//! FL2 Ruling 1 chose this over `chdb-rust` 2.0 — which is "experimental,
//! unstable" and pins its own Arrow — because Loams needs Arrow input
//! registration and query cancellation exactly as the C ABI offers them. Task 0
//! measured what that ABI actually is, and it is not the shape a guess would
//! produce: `chdb_connect(int argc, char ** argv)` rather than a path string,
//! `chdb_query(conn, query, format)` with no `char **error` out-parameter, and a
//! `_n` length-suffixed variant of everything
//! ([`docs/plans/fl2-dependency-spike.md`](../../../../docs/plans/fl2-dependency-spike.md) §3).
//! A first attempt to drive the library through hand-written `ctypes` bindings
//! that guessed the 1.x shape **segfaulted**. So the bindings here are generated
//! from the header the pinned binary was built from, and nothing in Loams ever
//! declares a prototype by hand.
//!
//! The header is `chdb.h`, vendored from `chdb-io/chdb-core` at tag v26.9.0
//! (`programs/local/chdb.h`, 1176 lines) because the v26.9.0 release tarball
//! ships `libchdb.so` and no header at all: Task 0 §2. The binary is pinned by
//! digest in `build.rs` — `linux-x86_64-libchdb.tar.gz` is
//! `c6398bcc71dc58d12fb81548540aacd5d8248830ec81cec537f51c114670543b`, which
//! unpacks to a single 554 MB stripped ELF — and the header is covered by review
//! instead. Ruling 2's `LIBCHDB_DIR` overrides the fetch for offline builds.
//!
//! This is the workspace's only crate with `unsafe` in it (see its
//! `Cargo.toml`: `-F unsafe_code` cannot be lowered from inside a crate, so the
//! workspace's `forbid` is restated as `allow` here and nowhere else). Every
//! `unsafe` block in Loams is a direct call into one of the declarations
//! `build.rs` generates from that header, or one of the few libc calls the House
//! worker's process needs and no safe crate offers: adopting its inherited
//! sockets and receiving the forwarder's ([`inherited`]), dropping its
//! capabilities ([`capabilities`], HS1 Task 6) and `_exit` ([`process`]).
//!
//! The [`ffi`] module below is the safe layer: it owns every `unsafe` block in
//! the workspace and hands out [`ffi::Connection`], [`ffi::Stream`],
//! [`ffi::ArrowStream`] and [`ffi::Error`] instead of raw handles, so that
//! `loams-chdb` — and anything else — can stay under the workspace's
//! `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. Each of its types states what it owns and what
//! happens when it drops.

#![allow(unsafe_code)]
// Ruling 1: the sanctioned exception, see the module docs.
// bindgen keeps the C names, so the generated declarations are `chdb_result`
// and `CHDBSuccess` rather than `ChdbResult` and `Success`. Rust's own casing
// lints are the one thing that must give way: the whole point of Ruling 1 is
// that the Rust name *is* the C symbol, so a renamed binding could no longer be
// checked against `chdb.h`, or against `nm`, by reading it.
#![allow(non_camel_case_types, non_upper_case_globals)]

/// * [`Stream`] and [`ArrowStream`] own a `chdb_result` and destroy it on drop.
///   Either can hand the handle to a [`CancelToken`] instead, which is how a
///   cancellation and a dropped stream never both destroy it.
/// * [`Error`] carries the engine's own words. A ClickHouse exception arrives as
