//! The supervisor's process half (HS1 Task 2, design §49 §4, §10.1, §12): starting
//! a worker, killing it, knowing why it died, and killing it at a deadline.
//!
//! # Starting a worker
//!
//! [`ProcessLauncher`] starts `loams-house-worker` with `posix_spawn`:
//!
//! * one end of a Unix socket pair is `dup2`'d onto **fd 3**, and every other
//!   descriptor the front holds is close-on-exec, so the worker inherits its own
//!   socket and nothing else;
//! * the environment is **empty**, so no bucket key or token the front holds can
//!   reach it (`worker_env_has_no_secret`), and the arguments are
//!   `loams_house_worker::WorkerArgs`, which carry none either;
//! * stdin and stdout are `/dev/null`; stderr is the front's, for chDB's own
//!   messages;
//! * it seals itself before libchdb boots (L3, HS1 Task 6): `--sandbox netns` by
//!   default on Linux, with its forwarder's socket on **fd 4** when the launcher
//!   has an upstream, and `--cgroup` naming the child the front made for it when
//!   the launcher owns a delegated cgroup ([`crate::sandbox`]).
//!
//! # Killing a worker
//!
//! Every exit the front causes is a `SIGKILL` (§49 §10.1): libchdb's shutdown path
//! is slow and has hung, so there is none. A pid is only safe to signal while it
//! has not been reaped, so the waiter thread first waits **without reaping**
//! (`waitid(…, WEXITED | WNOWAIT)`), marks the worker exited under the same lock
//! [`KillHandle::kill`] takes, and only then reaps. A kill therefore either reaches
//! the worker (alive, or a zombie that ignores it) or sees "exited" and does
//! nothing; it never reaches a recycled pid.
//!
//! # Why it died
//!
//! The reason is recorded before the signal is sent, so the lease that sees its
//! socket end can tell a cancellation (`394`) from a timeout (`159`), a memory
//! kill (`241`) and a crash nobody asked for (`210`). See [`ExitReason`].
