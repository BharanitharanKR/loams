//! Cancellation: a client that stops waiting does not have to wait for the engine.
//!
//! Like `tests/engine.rs`, this binary starts an engine of its own, because libchdb
//! locks its storage directory against another process's engine.
//!
//! Task 1 measured what libchdb v26.9.0 can and cannot do about a running statement,
//! and it shapes this test:
//!
//! * `chdb_stream_cancel_query` does **not** interrupt a statement. It blocks until
//!   the statement has finished on its own — `SELECT count() FROM numbers(1e12)`
//!   answered with its result after 275 s, and the cancel call returned a second
//!   earlier — and only then tears the stream down, after which a fetch says
//!   `"No active streaming query"` with no code.
//! * There is no `query_id` setting to name a statement with (`SET query_id` answers
//!   115 `UNKNOWN_SETTING`), so a cross-connection `KILL QUERY` has nothing to match
//!   on: `system.processes` lists ids the engine generated itself.
//!
//! So the cancellation a client sees is Loams': `Session::cancel` registers it, the
//! stream answers `394 QUERY_WAS_CANCELLED` at once, and the engine is asked to stop in the
//! background. That is what "cancelled within 1 s" can mean against this ABI, and
//! this test is what says so.
