//! Streaming results: [`QueryStream`], its [`QueryStats`], and the registry
//! [`crate::Session::cancel`] needs to reach a running statement.
//!
//! chDB streams a result in blocks: `chdb_stream_query_n` starts the statement and
//! hands back a handle, `chdb_stream_fetch_result` returns one block at a time,
//! and a block of length zero ends the stream. Task 1 measured three blocks for
//! 100 000 rows in `RowBinary`, so a client that wants the last block early has to
//! ask for it — which is exactly what a streaming HTTP body does.
//!
//! The statistics are the ones ClickHouse puts in `X-ClickHouse-Summary`, which
//! Task 2 will write verbatim, and the header's naming is confusing enough to be
//! worth spelling out: `chdb_result_rows_read` counts the rows **in the result**,
//! while `chdb_result_storage_rows_read` counts the rows read **from storage**. So
//! [`QueryStats::result_rows`] and [`QueryStats::rows_read`] come from the two
//! different calls.
