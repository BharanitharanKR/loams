//! Sessions: one chDB connection each, which is where a House `session_id`'s
//! isolation comes from.
//!
//! A `Session` owns a connection of its own, and Task 1 measured that the
//! isolation is real: a setting changed on one connection is not visible on
//! another, and a temporary table created on one does not exist on the other. That
//! matters because the House's `session_id` has to keep settings and the current
//! database (Task 4), and chDB has no session concept of its own.
//!
//! Two measured facts shape the rest of it:
//!
//! * **`chdb_connect` refuses a second connection whose server-level arguments
//!   differ from the first one's** — the second call returns null. A session
//!   therefore takes the engine's arguments, and its [`Settings`] are applied per
//!   statement, as a `SET` before each one. Differing *query-level* arguments are
//!   accepted (HS1 R1.9), which [`crate::Engine::session_with_args`] uses for the
//!   House worker's `--readonly=2` user connection.
//! * **A cancellation spends the connection it happened on.** After
//!   `chdb_stream_cancel_query`, the next streaming statement on that connection
//!   answers `"No active streaming query"`, with no code and no way to recover the
//!   connection (measured: the connection was reusable for `SELECT`, but not for a
//!   stream). So a cancelled session opens a fresh connection for its next
//!   statement, with the same arguments, which is the one connection shape chDB
//!   allows.
