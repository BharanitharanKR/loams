//! The engine: one chDB connection set for the whole process, which is what
//! `libchdb.so` actually offers.
//!
//! libchdb is not a server Loams can ask for two engines in: one process holds
//! one engine, one storage path, one set of server settings. `chdb_connect`
//! returns a pointer to a connection, and `chdb_close_conn` shuts the engine
//! down when it closes the last one — with the caveat the pinned header spells
//! out, that repeatedly closing the last connection and reconnecting puts the
//! engine through a full shutdown and boot each time, which is slow and is
//! "known to corrupt the process allocator on macOS". So [`Engine`] keeps one
//! connection of its own for the life of the process (it lives in a `OnceLock`
//! and is never dropped) and every [`Session`](crate::Session) borrows its own
//! connection alongside it.
//!
//! [`Engine::start`] is process-global. The first call boots; a later call with
//! the same configuration returns the same engine, and one with a different
//! configuration is refused rather than silently ignored — a second engine is not
//! something this library can give, so the answer has to be an error the caller
//! can see.
