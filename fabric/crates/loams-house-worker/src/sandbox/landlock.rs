//! The worker's Landlock rules (L3, §49 §13.2; HS1 R1.10, R1.11).
//!
//! What the worker may touch on the file system, once the rules are in force:
//!
//! * **read and write** its private directory (chDB's `--path`, its config, its
//!   working directory and `user_files_path`, R1.10) and nothing else;
//! * **read** the code it runs: every file mapped into the process when the
//!   rules are made (the worker binary, `libchdb.so` wherever the build put it,
//!   the C library), the system library directories, and the time zone data;
//! * **read** the few kernel files chDB sizes itself from (`/proc/self`, CPU and
//!   memory counts, its cgroup's limits) and `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`.
//!
//! Not `/etc` (only `/etc/localtime` and the loader's `/etc/ld.so.cache`), not
//! `/home`, not another process's
//! `/proc/<pid>`. TCP: no `bind` at all, and `connect` only to the ports given
//! (the forwarder's). From ABI 6 on, the worker also cannot signal or reach the
//! abstract Unix sockets of processes outside its domain, and from ABI 9 on it
//! cannot connect to any pathname Unix socket.
//!
//! Landlock ABI 4 (Linux 6.7) is required, for the TCP rules (R1.11); newer
//! rights are added where the kernel has them and reported in the status.
