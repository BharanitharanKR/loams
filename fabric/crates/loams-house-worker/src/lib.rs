//! The Loams House worker (HS1 Task 2, design §49 §4): the only binary that links
//! libchdb.
//!
//! The front (`loams-fabric house`) starts it with `posix_spawn`, an empty
//! environment, the arguments of [`config::WorkerArgs`] and one end of a Unix
//! socket pair on fd 3. The worker seals itself first ([`sandbox`], L3, HS1
//! Task 6: its own user and network namespace reached only through the
//! [`forwarder`], Landlock, seccomp, no capabilities), then writes its own chDB
//! configuration (explicit grants, no disk cache), boots the engine, sends
//! `Ready`, waits for `Bind`, and then serves `Execute`s for that one namespace
//! until the front kills it. It has no shutdown path: the front ends it with
//! `SIGKILL` (§49 §10.1), and a worker whose socket closes exits at once.
//!
//! The library half is the same serve loop, so `loams-house`'s `InprocWorker`
//! (feature `inproc-worker`) can run it on a thread of the front for development.
