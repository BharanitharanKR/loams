//! Errors: the code, the name, the HTTP status and the rendering, checked against
//! ClickHouse rather than against the House's own opinion of them (FL2 Task 3).
//!
//! Moved here from `loams-house/tests` by HS1 Task 2: the front no longer links
//! libchdb (D761), so the tests that run statements on the pinned library live
//! with the worker, the one package that does, and reach `loams-house` the way the
//! front does — through `loams_house_ipc::EngineError`.
//!
//! # What "the reference" is here, and what it is not
//!
//! The plan asks each test to compare a Loams-raised error with the reference's own
//! answer. **There is no reference `clickhouse-server` in this sandbox** — that
//! arrives with Task 10's differential harness — so the reference these tests compare
//! against is two things that can be checked here, and the difference matters:
//!
//! * **The code, the name and the status** come from ClickHouse's own source at tag
//!   `v26.9.4.3-stable`: `src/Common/ErrorCodes.cpp` for the names,
//!   `src/Server/HTTP/exceptionCodeToHTTPStatus.cpp` for the statuses. Both files are
//!   the authority ClickHouse itself uses, transcribed in [`REFERENCE_CODES`] below.
//!   They are a *source* reading, not an observation, and `errors.rs`'s module
//!   documentation says what must be re-checked when a server exists.
//! * **The message** comes from the pinned `libchdb.so` v26.9.0 running the statement
//!   in this binary, recorded in [`ENGINE_CASES`]. That is the same ClickHouse code
//!   path a reference server runs, in the same release family, so the wording is the
//!   engine's own rather than a transcription — but it is the *library's* wording, not
//!   a server's, and the two could differ in the parts a server adds (its own system
//!   tables behind "Maybe you meant …").
//!
//! What cannot be honoured here at all is the trigger for the codes only the HTTP
//! layer raises. Those are listed in [`HOUSE_CASES`] with the component that owns the
//! trigger, and the test asserts what is Task 3's — the code, the name, the status, the
//! rendering and the mid-stream rule — rather than pretending to have run a request.
//! No test in this file passes by asserting nothing.
//!
//! # One engine per process
//!
//! The three tests share this binary's engine, as `loams-chdb`'s tests do: each asks
//! for the same [`EngineConfig`], and the storage directory is this binary's own name
//! because libchdb locks its storage directory against another process's engine.
