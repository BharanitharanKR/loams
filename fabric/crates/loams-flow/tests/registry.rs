//! CN1 plan Task 2: the 200-connector registry and the drift checks around it.
//!
//! The registry is loaded from the repository's own `connectors/` tree, found through
//! `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` rather than the current directory, because the crate
//! reads the repository at run time (D352, D359) and a test that depended on the
//! working directory would pass only where it happened to be launched.
//!
//! Two of these tests re-implement a little of `scripts/connectors/gen_registry.py`
//! on purpose — the hand-rolled CSV reader and the Appendix A renderer — because the
//! point of each is that the Rust side and the Python side agree without one calling
//! the other. Where the two conventions differ, the comment says which is which.
