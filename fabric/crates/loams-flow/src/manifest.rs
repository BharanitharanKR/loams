//! The connector manifest: §33 §4's YAML as typed Rust, and the protobuf form
//! that mirrors it one to one.
//!
//! A manifest is one versioned YAML document per connector at
//! `connectors/registry/<id>.yaml` (design §33 D352). The YAML is the source of
//! truth — §33 §4's last paragraph says the protobuf form mirrors it one to one
//! and CI checks that both agree — so every field and every enum here carries
//! the **exact YAML slug** of the manifest, and `to_proto`/`from_proto` are the
//! only place a slug becomes a protobuf name such as `ORDERING_PER_KEY`.
//!
//! Three shapes are worth naming, because each of them is a place the design,
//! the JSON Schema and CN1 plan Task 1 did not agree:
//!
//! * **`RuntimeSpec` is a struct, not an enum.** §33 §4's `runtime` is
//!   `{kind, ref, version}` and its `ref` comment fixes one meaning per `kind`,
//!   so a five-variant Rust enum would have to restate that mapping and could
//!   drift from the YAML. D352 makes the YAML canonical, so the struct wins;
//!   `connector.proto`'s `RuntimeRef` is a message for the same reason.
//! * **`config_ref` is the path and `config_schema` is the resolved document.**
//!   §33 §4's `config: {$ref: …}` is a repository-relative path and D353's
//!   manifest declares the shape of an instance's settings, so the loader
//!   resolves the reference and keeps the document. `config_schema` is skipped
//!   when serializing — the path is what round-trips.
//! * **`apiVersion` and `kind` are not fields.** `connector.schema.json` makes
//!   them `const` and `connector.proto` gives them no field, whose own header
//!   comment says so. `to_json`/`to_yaml` write them and the schema checks them.
//!
//! [`ConnectorSpec::to_proto`] and [`ConnectorSpec::from_proto`] are the pair
//! `proto_and_yaml_agree` drives over all 21 ★ manifests.
