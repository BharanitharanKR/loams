//! `hsw1`: the frames between the Loams House front and its chDB workers
//! (design §49 §4.2, HS1 Task 2).
//!
//! The front (`loams-fabric house`, which links no libchdb) and the worker
//! (`loams-house-worker`, the only binary that does) talk over one Unix-domain
//! socket per worker. The worker inherits its end as fd 3. This crate is the whole
//! contract between them, and it carries no libchdb, so the front can depend on it.
//!
//! # The wire
//!
//! ```text
//! u32 length (big-endian, counts what follows) | u8 version | postcard(Frame)
//! ```
//!
//! A frame longer than [`MAX_FRAME_BYTES`] is refused before anything is
//! allocated for it, so a compromised worker cannot make the front reserve 4 GiB
//! with four bytes. A version byte other than [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] is
//! [`CodecError::UnknownVersion`], and a worker that reads one exits with
//! [`EXIT_PROTOCOL`] (70, `EX_SOFTWARE`).
//!
//! # The conversation
//!
//! ```text
//! worker                                   front
//!   boots libchdb, connects
//!   Ready ------------------------------->
//!         <------------------------------- Bind          (once, before any Execute)
//!   Done | Error ------------------------>
//!         <------------------------------- Execute
//!         <------------------------------- Input* InputEnd   (only if Execute.input)
//!   (Chunk | Progress)* then
//!   Stats Done | Error ------------------>
//!         <------------------------------- Execute …
//! ```
//!
//! Every request (`Bind`, `Execute`) ends in exactly one terminal frame: `Done`
//! (success) or `Error` (failure). A successful `Execute` sends `Stats` just before
//! its `Done`. There is **no `Cancel` frame**: cancelling is `SIGKILL` of the
//! worker, and the front answers the client itself (§49 §4.2, §12).
//!
//! Postcard encodes an enum by variant index, so a front and a worker must be built
//! from the same [`Frame`]; the version byte is what changes when they cannot be.
