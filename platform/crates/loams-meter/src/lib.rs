//! `loams-meter`: Loams Cloud's node metering agent (design 01, MB0).
//!
//! The agent runs once per node (a DaemonSet), outside every tenant sandbox.
//! Each tick it reads cgroup v2 counters ([`cgroup`]), turns them into
//! per-window deltas ([`delta`]), resolves the tenant ([`resolver`]), writes
//! CloudEvents meter events ([`event`]) to its on-disk spool ([`spool`]) and
//! only then advances its baselines. A forwarder drains the spool into the
//! Loams stream `_system/_meter` ([`stream`], through the [`sink::Sink`]
//! trait). Every event carries the idempotency key `<node>/<source>/<seq>`,
//! so retries and replays never double-count.
//!
//! Not here yet: the kube resolver and inotify final reads (MB2), Envoy ALS
//! (MB3), the wasmtime host socket (MB4) and the aggregator (MB1).
