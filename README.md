**One bucket, every index: hybrid retrieval on object storage, with reactive data and durable agent runs beside it.**

Loams is an open-source, AI-native data platform in Rust. It keeps your data in *your* object-storage bucket (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, RustFS or a local directory) in open formats: Lance and Tantivy today, Iceberg next. Compute is stateless and holds only caches.

> **0.1.0 — first release.** You run the stack yourself with Docker Compose, locally or on your own VMs, over your own Tailscale tailnet, and use the hosted console at [console.loams.dev](https://console.loams.dev). 0.x: APIs and on-disk formats may change between minor versions; upgrades are supported with `loams upgrade`.

## Why Loams

A typical AI application runs Elasticsearch, Qdrant, a graph database, Kafka and a workflow engine: five stateful clusters, several copies of the same data, and retrieval glued together in application code. Loams replaces them with one engine on one bucket:

- **Your bucket is the source of truth.** Object-storage prices, no 3× block-storage replication; losing a node loses no data.
- **The log is the spine.** Every write lands in a log; collections are materializations of it, and every write returns a consistency token later reads can wait on.
- **Hybrid retrieval in one plan.** Vectors, BM25 and filters fused with RRF in one DataFusion query, with hot tiers in RAM and NVMe.
- **Drop-in APIs.** Existing Qdrant and Elasticsearch clients (and LangChain and LlamaIndex on top of them) work unmodified, plus Arrow Flight SQL.
- **More than retrieval.** Reactive documents (Live), graphs (Graph), analytics (House), MySQL and Postgres, and durable agent runs (Durable), on the same storage.

## What ships in 0.1.0

| | |
|---|---|
| **Retrieval engine** | Collections, hybrid search, SQL, streams and links; native REST, Arrow Flight SQL, Qdrant and Elasticsearch APIs; Postgres and MySQL wire |
| **Loams Live** | A reactive document database: transactions, indexes and live queries |
| **Loams Graph** | GQL graphs, with writes on the Loams log and crash recovery. Experimental: graph expansion for GraphRAG (1 to 2 hops from search hits, and SQL `graph_*` functions) |
| **Loams House** | Experimental. ClickHouse-compatible analytics with engine-level access control (opt-in profile) |
| **Loams SQL / Postgres** | MySQL on a patched TiDB; Postgres on our Neon fork, storage on the bucket |
| **Loams Durable** | Durable promises and tasks for agent runs (an embedded Resonate server) |
| **Console, desktop, CLI** | Hosted web console; Loams Desktop and the `loams` CLI for Linux, macOS and Windows |
| **Loams Studio** | Experimental. An agentic development environment in the console's Studio mode: coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, opencode and others) in threads with a git worktree each, diff review, git actions, terminals, previews and parallel runs, all through the `loams-agentd` daemon. On by default in Loams Desktop; in the browser it runs against a remote `loams-agentd` and is behind a feature flag ([guides](docs/guides/studio/index.md)) |
| **Loams Git** | Experimental. `git-remote-loams`, git's remote helper, ships with the `loams` CLI packages: `git clone`, `fetch` and `push` reach a Loams Git repository on a bucket, with no server in between |
| **SDKs** | TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, C#, C++ and Swift (more languages coming). Published to npm, PyPI, crates.io, NuGet and the Go proxy as `0.1.0`; Swift from the release tag, C++ as a release tarball <!-- verify after publish --> |

**Coming next:** Loams Git on the server (repositories in the release images), first-party connectors, Iceberg analytics, Kafka wire, functions and jobs. The full status table is in [Running Loams](docs/release/preview.md); the plan is in the [roadmap](docs/design/12-roadmap-testing-risks.md).

## Quick start

Run the whole stack (needs Docker Compose and a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) auth key):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ostrium-labs/loams.git
cd loams/deploy/release
cp .env.example .env        # set TS_AUTHKEY
docker compose up -d
```

Then open [console.loams.dev](https://console.loams.dev) on a device on the same tailnet and enter `https://loams.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`. Details, BYOC over SSH and auth modes: [Running Loams](docs/release/preview.md).

Or build just the engine and run it on one machine:

```sh
cargo run --release -p loams -- dev    # native API on 127.0.0.1:8080, Qdrant on :6333, Elasticsearch on :9200
```

Examples for the native API, Qdrant clients, Flight SQL and reading the bucket directly are in the [engine quick start](docs/engine-quickstart.md).

## Repository

The engine crates, the web console, Loams Desktop, the mobile apps, SDKs, protos, connectors and deploy files all live here; see the [project layout](docs/project-layout.md) and the [monorepo guide](docs/monorepo.md). Design documents are in [`docs/design`](docs/design/README.md) and task-by-task plans in [`docs/plans`](docs/plans/README.md).

## Code signing policy

- **Linux and checksums:** the release workflows sign `.deb`, `.pacman`, AppImage and `SHA256SUMS` with the [project GPG key](docs/release/loams-release-key.asc), set up on 2026-10-16; `.rpm` packages are planned for SignPath. The previews so far shipped without it: a file built without its signing credentials is named `-unsigned`, as every v0.1.0-preview.2 desktop file is, and the release notes say so.
- **Windows and macOS:** unsigned today. The Windows (Authenticode) and `.rpm` signing steps through [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org) are built into the release workflows, but the application is not made yet, so nothing is signed that way; it will be made once the project has traction. macOS stays unsigned and not notarized.
- **Verify a download:** `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`, then `gpg --import docs/release/loams-release-key.asc` (fingerprint `333A C945 99D5 A1EB 2A41 6D1E 83DC 134D 8CAF 895D`) and `gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS`.
- **Roles:** the three SignPath roles (authors, reviewers, approvers) are the repository's maintainers and owners; the named people will be listed here once the application is approved. Details: [signing policy](docs/release/signing.md), [desktop releases](docs/release/desktop.md).
