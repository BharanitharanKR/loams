// One call, and the binding table the facade dispatches through (design §44
// §7.3, D606; runtime contract R2, R3, R8).
//
// A `MethodBinding` is what the generated facade would carry: the RPC's name, its
// retry class, whether its request declares an idempotency key, whether it is
// server-streaming, and which two fields its pagination uses. **Every** of those
// comes from the proto's annotations or its schema rather than from a guess, and
// a caller can read the table to see what the SDK believes about an RPC.
//
// `loams::Client::Invoke` is the whole call path — auth, R3's key, R2's retry,
// R1's one refresh, R8's mapping — in one function. The facade methods and the
// conformance suite both sit on it, which is what makes "the suite exercises
// the public surface" true rather than a claim.
