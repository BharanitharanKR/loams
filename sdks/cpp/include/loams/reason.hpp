// The `ErrorInfo.reason` registry, as a type (design §44 §7.4, D611; runtime
// contract R8).
//
// `reason` is the stable branch a caller switches on. It is **generated from
// the registry page** `docs/api/reasons.md`, so it is a closed enum here: a
// reason the registry has lost stops compiling, and a reason a *newer* server
// returns is not silently turned into "some other reason" (see `error.hpp`'s
// `LoamsError::UnknownReason`).
//
// Three things are deliberately distinct and are not conflated:
//
//   - a reason from a **newer** server, which this enum does not have. It is
//     surfaced as text in `UnknownReason` and flagged, never dropped: losing it
//     would leave a caller unable to tell "not supported here" from "not
//     supported at all".
//   - a failure from **below the API** — a socket, a refused connection, a
//     timeout — which carries no `reason` at all.
//   - a mapped `LoamsError`, which is returned unchanged if mapped twice.
//
// The enum values here are generated from the registry table in the order that
// page lists them, and `scripts/docs/check-decision-ids.sh`'s sibling,
// `crates/loams`'s `reasons_are_snake_case_and_unique`, is the authority: the
// page changes first, then this file.
