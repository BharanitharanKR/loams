// swift-tools-version: 6.0
//
// The SwiftPM manifest for the Swift SDK (SDK2 Task 4, Loams issue #288).
//
// Platform floors are the plan's (SDK2 Task 4: "iOS 15+/macOS 12+/Linux"):
// `swift-tools-version: 6.0` is Swift 6, and `.macOS(.v12)` / `.iOS(.v15)` are
// the lowest versions whose Foundation has the async `URLSession` APIs the
// transport is written against. Linux is supported and needs no declaration
// here — SwiftPM treats a platform with no entry as "any".
//
// # There are no package dependencies, and that is a decision
//
// The language matrix row 5 says Swift is Connect over `connect-swift`, and that
// remains the intent. This manifest does not depend on it yet, for a reason
// recorded in `README.md` and `DEPENDENCIES.md`: **the Swift toolchain was not
// available on the machine that wrote this SDK**, so no single API of
// `connect-swift` could be checked against a compiler. Pinning a dependency
// whose entire surface is unverified would make `swift build` fail during
// resolution — before compiling a line of this SDK's own code — and would hide
// whether the code below is correct.
//
// So the transport is written directly against the Connect wire protocol over
// `URLSession`, and it sits behind `HTTPTransport`, which is the seam where
// `connect-swift` slots in. See `Sources/Loams/Transport.swift` for the exact
// boundary. Adding the dependency is then a contained change to one file, and it
// can be made by whoever has a toolchain.
