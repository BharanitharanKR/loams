// SDK2 Task 4's conformance suite, in the six names the plan states.
//
// The corpus in `sdks/fixtures` is recorded from a real `loams dev`, and this runs
// every case in it through the SDK's **public** surface — `client.instance` and
// `client.tables`, the same objects an application uses — rather than through the
// internals. That is the point of the suite: it proves the facade dispatches to
// the right RPC, sends the right encoding, and turns what comes back into the right
// typed value.
//
// Three things are covered, which between them are what the design asks of a
// conforming SDK (design §44 §10.4):
//
//   - a successful call, in the encoding an SDK sends by default;
//   - a structured-reason error, with `reason` and not the message;
//   - the unavailable-service path, in all three of its shapes: the guard that
//     costs no RPC, the refusal a call gets, and the refusal on a stream.
//
// # Swift, and the names of tests
//
// `sdks/conformance/check-languages.mjs` reads this file's **source** and counts
// how many of the six canonical names appear, so each name is a `let` binding with
// the canonical string rather than a comment — a name in a comment would satisfy a
// reader and not the checker.
//
// Swift has no subtests, so the canonical names cannot be `XCTestCase` method
// names verbatim (they start with a letter, not `test`). They are therefore the
// constants below, each attached to the method that pins it, and
// `testConformanceTestNames` asserts the set cannot quietly shrink — which is the
// same claim the Go SDK makes with its registry.
