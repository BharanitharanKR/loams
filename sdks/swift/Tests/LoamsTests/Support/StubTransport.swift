// A transport that answers from a script, for the tests that do not need a server.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// R2's retry loop, R3's key reuse and R7's resume are all about what the SDK does
// **between** attempts. A recorded fixture corpus pins what the SDK does with a
// *successful* response and with a *refusal*; it cannot pin "the first attempt
// failed with `unavailable` and the second carried the same idempotency key",
// because the corpus has no such case — the recorded server never failed that way
// on purpose.
//
// So those clauses are pinned against a transport that answers from a script, the
// same shape every other SDK's suite uses for this (``stream_resume_test.go``
// drives a Go stub, ``stream_resume_with_cursor`` drives a TypeScript one). The
// stub records what it was asked to send, which is what makes R3 checkable at all:
// the assertion is over the **bodies the transport saw**, not over the SDK's
// internals.
