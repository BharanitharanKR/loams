// The conformance fixture server (design §44 §10.4, SDK1 Task 4).
//
// The corpus in `sdks/fixtures` is recorded from a real `loams dev`, and every
// SDK's suite replays it so thirteen clients can be compared against the same
// bytes. This file is how a Swift test gets one.
//
// Two ways to get an endpoint, in the order they are tried:
//
//  1. `LOAMS_TEST_ENDPOINT` — a live `loams dev`. This short-circuits everything
//     else, which is how `sdks/conformance/run.sh` runs the same suite in CI
//     against a recording and on a developer machine against the real thing.
//  2. `node sdks/conformance/fixture-server.mjs` — the shared server. Preferred,
//     because then the Swift suite really does run against the same server the
//     other twelve do.
//
// # There is no third way, and that is a deliberate difference from the Go SDK
//
// The Go suite's third fallback is an in-process replay of `sdks/fixtures/recorded`
// over `net/http/httptest`, because Go's standard library has an HTTP server and a
// Go module's `go test` should not need a JavaScript runtime.
//
// **Swift has no equivalent in its standard library.** An in-process HTTP server
// would mean hand-writing one over BSD sockets, or taking a dependency on
// SwiftNIO — and a hand-written socket server that is never run because the
// machine has no toolchain is exactly the kind of green-but-unverified thing this
// repository has been burned by. So there is no in-process replay.
//
// What replaces it is that `loamsUnavailableFixtureServer` **fails** rather than
// skipping. A suite that could not reach a fixture server has not run the corpus,
// and reporting that as a pass is precisely the failure mode R7's own doc comment
// warns about for streams. The remedy is one of the two things above, and the
// error message names both.
//
// What all paths agree on is the corpus: ``readCorpus()`` reads
// `sdks/fixtures/index.json` and the test fails if a case is missing, so a suite
// cannot quietly stop covering something.
