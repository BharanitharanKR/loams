// Transports (design §44 §4, D612; runtime contract R10).
//
// One port serves the Connect protocol, gRPC and gRPC-Web (D600), so the only
// question a Swift client has is which of those it would rather speak. This file
// speaks two of them directly and leaves gRPC to `connect-swift`'s `ConnectNIO`,
// because gRPC needs HTTP trailers that `URLSession` cannot expose:
//
//   - **Connect**, unary and server-streaming. Connect's streaming is a plain
//     chunked HTTP response, so it works over HTTP/1.1, and so does everything a
//     TLS terminator, an ingress or a corporate proxy in front of the instance
//     understands. This is the default, because it is the one that works
//     everywhere.
//   - **gRPC-Web**, unary and server-streaming. A browser can only do gRPC-Web,
//     and a caller behind a proxy that only speaks gRPC-Web needs it. The
//     difference from Connect is that gRPC-Web puts its trailers in the body
//     rather than in HTTP trailers, which is why the whole protocol works over
//     `URLSession`.
//   - **gRPC** is **not** spoken by this file: it needs real trailers, which
//     `URLSession` does not expose. It arrives with `connect-swift`'s `ConnectNIO`
//     product (D612) — see the note in `Package.swift`.
//
// R10 ("the browser is a first-class target") is restated the Swift way rather
// than skipped: `Foundation`'s `URLSession` is available on every Apple platform
// the SDK targets and is the **only** networking API in the SDK, so there is no
// entry point that has to avoid a platform-specific socket call, and the default
// path is one that a `WKWebView` and a server-side process can both take.
//
// # The seam
//
// ``HTTPTransport`` is a protocol, and ``CallInvoker`` is written against it and
// nothing else. `connect-swift` conforms to its own `HTTPClientInterface`, so
// adopting it is a conformance plus a change of one factory call — not a rewrite
// of the runtime. That boundary is the reason the protocol is written directly
// rather than against a library whose surface could not be compiled here.
