// Token sources (design §44 §7.4, D608; runtime contract R1).
//
// A `TokenSource` returns a bearer and can be asked for a new one. Tokens travel
// in `Authorization: Bearer` and **never** in a URL: a query string ends up in
// proxy logs, in browser history and in `Referer`. A `401` carrying `reason =
// token_expired` triggers one refresh and one retry; that logic lives in the call
// path (`CallInvoker.swift`), so a source stays a source.
//
// In Swift a source is a protocol with two requirements, and the refresh is
// optional-by-behaviour rather than optional-by-type: a source that cannot refresh
// — an API key, which does not expire — returns from ``TokenSource/refresh()``
// without minting anything, which is the no-op R1 describes.
//
// `refresh()` is `async throws` because fetching a token is a network call, and
// Swift will not let a call be cancelled without one.
