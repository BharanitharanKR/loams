// The typed error hierarchy of design §44 §7.4, decision D611.
//
// A failed RPC carries a Connect code and one `loams.errors.v1.ErrorInfo` in its
// details. The `reason` is what callers branch on: a stable `snake_case` string,
// registered in `docs/api/reasons.md` and carried in ``Reason``, so a caller
// switches on a case and a reason the registry has lost stops compiling. The
// message is for people and may change; nothing in an SDK branches on it.
//
// In Swift the branch is `catch let error as LoamsError` and then a `switch` on
// `error.reason`, which is why the hierarchy exists:
//
//     do {
//         let info = try await client.instance.getInstance()
//     } catch let error as FeatureNotInVariantError {
//         // this build variant does not carry the package
//     } catch let error as LoamsError where error.reason == .notFound {
//         // the named resource does not exist
//     }
//
// and for a class rather than a reason:
//
//     } catch let error as UnauthenticatedError {
//         // the caller is not authenticated, for any reason
//     }
//
// Three cases are distinct and are not conflated:
//
//   - a reason from a **newer** server, which this SDK's registry does not have:
//     it is surfaced as text in ``LoamsError/unknownReason`` and flagged, not
//     dropped;
//   - a failure from **below the API** — a socket, a refused connection, a
//     cancelled task — which carries no `reason` at all;
//   - a ``LoamsError``, which is returned unchanged if it is mapped twice, so
//     wrapping an SDK's own error never loses its reason.
//
// # Swift's one structural difference from the other twelve SDKs
//
// Go and TypeScript both give every subclass a *distinct type* and let the
// language's error-matching machinery do the work. Swift's `catch` pattern
// matching over an `enum` does the same job with less ceremony, so this is one
// `enum` rather than a class per code. The consequence a caller should know: a
// `catch let error as FeatureNotInVariantError` only compiles because of the
// `errorLoamsPattern` helpers below, which destructure the enum — see
// ``FeatureNotInVariantError`` for why that indirection exists.
