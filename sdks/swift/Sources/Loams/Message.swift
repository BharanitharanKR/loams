// The message and JSON foundation the runtime is written against.
//
// # Why this file exists at all
//
// Every other SDK's runtime sits on **generated** protobuf message types:
// `protoc-gen-go` writes `*loams.GetInstanceRequest`, `protoc-gen-swift` writes
// `Loams_Instance_V1_GetInstanceRequest`. Design §44 §7.3 and D606 say the
// module surface is generated and **only the runtime is hand-written**.
//
// For Swift neither of those exists yet. There is no `swift.rs` in
// `crates/loams-facade-gen` (it ships `typescript.rs`, `python.rs`, `go.rs` and
// `rust.rs`), there is no `sdks/templates/swift/`, there is no `swift` case in
// `scripts/sdk/gen.sh`, and no `protoc-gen-swift` output for `proto/` is checked
// in anywhere in this repository. So this file defines the seam those types will
// plug into rather than pretending they exist.
//
// The seam is `LoamsMessage`: a protocol, not a concrete struct, and every piece
// of the runtime that touches a request or a response is generic over it. The
// one concrete implementation shipped today is `DynamicMessage`, which is what
// the tests and the example use. When the Swift protobuf stubs land,
// `DynamicMessage` is deleted, real message types conform to `LoamsMessage`, and
// **nothing in the runtime changes** — which is the whole point of making it a
// protocol rather than a struct.
//
// The protocol is deliberately tiny: the runtime only ever needs to read and write
// five fields by name, and read a repeated field for the pagination iterator.
// Everything else is opaque bytes to it. That is the same shape as the Go SDK,
// which reaches the same fields by generated Go field name (`IdempotencyKey`,
// `PageToken`, `NextPageToken`, `ConsistencyToken`) — Go does it with
// reflection, Swift does it through this protocol, and both are reading the *proto
// field name* rather than a guess.
