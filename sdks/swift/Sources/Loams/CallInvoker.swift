// The call path (design §44 §7.4; runtime contract R1, R2 and R3 all land here).
//
// One function runs every RPC, and the three clauses it has to satisfy at once
// are:
//
//   - **R1** — a `401` carrying `reason = token_expired` triggers **exactly one**
//     refresh and **one** retry; a second expiry is reported.
//   - **R2** — the retry class comes from the generated binding, the backoff is
//     full-jittered, and a call the class does not cover is not retried.
//   - **R3** — the idempotency key is decided **once per logical call**, before the
//     first attempt, and the *same* key goes out on every retry.
//
// # Why they are in one place
//
// Separating them is how R3 gets broken: a retry loop that re-derives its request
// per attempt will mint a second key, and one write becomes two — the exact
// failure the key exists to prevent. So `request` is computed **once**, before the
// loop, and every attempt sends the very same message. The key is part of that
// message, which makes key reuse structural rather than a rule someone has to
// remember.
//
// R1's "exactly one" is likewise structural: ``refreshed`` is a `let` binding
// outside the loop, and a second expiry cannot refresh again because the flag is
// already set and the only remaining branch is the one that gives up.
