//
// This is the layer D606 says is generated. **For Swift it is the Q604
// hand-written fallback** (see `Facade.swift`'s header), and it is the file the
// facade renderer would replace: every method below resolves its binding from
// ``loamsBinding(module:call:)`` and hands it to the one ``CallInvoker``, so there
// is no RPC path and no retry class in this file. That is what makes annotating a
// proto enough to add an SDK method, and it is why ``ConformanceTests`` can
// assert that every binding in the catalogue has a method by checking that
// resolving each one succeeds.
