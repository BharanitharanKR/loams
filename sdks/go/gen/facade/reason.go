// Reason is a stable, machine-readable cause of a failed RPC
// (design §44 §7.4, D611). It is generated from `docs/api/reasons.md`, so a
// caller switching on it is exhaustive over the registry this SDK was built
// against, and a reason the registry has lost stops compiling.
//
// It is a distinct string type rather than `string` on purpose: that is what
// makes `errors.As`-free exhaustiveness possible, and it is why the wire value
// has to go through `KnownReason` before it becomes a `Reason`.
type Reason string

// Every reason in the registry. Transcribed from `docs/api/reasons.md`; the test
// `TestReasonRegistryMatchesDocs` reads that page and fails on a drift, so this
// list cannot silently fall behind.
