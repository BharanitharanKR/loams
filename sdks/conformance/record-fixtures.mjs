// Records the conformance fixture corpus against real `loams` servers.
//
// This is SDK1 Task 4's recorder. It speaks raw HTTP to whatever endpoint it is
// pointed at, saves the exact status, headers and body bytes of each case under
// `sdks/fixtures/recorded/<server>/`, and writes the projections a per-SDK
// suite reads: `status.json` (what each transport answered), `error.json` (one
// row per recorded `reason`), `state.json` (the ordered multi-step scenarios)
// and `manifest.json` (the single authority on which fixtures are required).
//
// Why a recording at all (design §44 §10.4): the per-SDK suite has to run in CI
// on every PR, and CI cannot afford to boot a Rust server for each of the
// thirteen SDKs on every change. So the corpus is captured once from a real
// server, committed, and replayed by `fixture-server.mjs`. `run.sh` still
// offers the live path for the job that can afford it.
//
// ## The two servers, and why both are needed
//
// `loams dev` is the **primary** target (D617). It answers a successful unary
// call and both structured-reason refusals, in every encoding. It is run with
// `--no-live`: the unavailable-service cases are `loams.live.v1` refusing with
// `feature_not_in_variant`, which is what that package answers while Live is not
// running. With Live on (the default since LV1 Task 12) the same RPCs reach the
// running Live server instead and answer `not_found`.
//
// It cannot answer a paged list, an idempotency-keyed mutation or a resumable
// stream, because `loams.collection.v1` has not landed and the app packages are
// not served by it at all (design §44 §8; plan API1 Tasks 2–4). Those fixtures
// come from `loams-apps-mock` (AP0 Task 5), which implements the app services
// for real — its `acceptance` module is the server's own decision rules — and
// records them under `recorded/apps-mock/`.
//
// **Nothing here is hand-written.** Where a behaviour has no server that
// produces it, the recorder says so in `error.json`'s `unproducible` list
// rather than inventing bytes for it. See `docs/sdk/fixtures.md`.
//
// ## Recorded, not derived
//
// Every unary RPC is recorded in every encoding an SDK's transport might pick,
// because the response body is **not interchangeable** between them. The
// browser's gRPC-Web path and the streaming envelope each get a case: the
// unavailable-service path in particular arrives differently on a stream.
//
// Streams are recorded as a **bounded prefix**: a watch stream never ends, so
// the recorder reads N frames or until a deadline, records what arrived, and
// closes. That is a recording of what the server said, not a reconstruction.
//
// Timestamps are the one field that cannot be identical between two runs,
// because the mock's seed is relative to `now`. Every fixture that carries one
// declares the field names in `volatile`, and `verify-corpus.mjs` masks exactly
// those when it compares a re-recording. Nothing else is allowed to drift.
//
// Usage:
//   node sdks/conformance/record-fixtures.mjs                       # both servers
//   node sdks/conformance/record-fixtures.mjs --source loams-dev
//   node sdks/conformance/record-fixtures.mjs --source apps-mock --only error
//   node sdks/conformance/record-fixtures.mjs --source app --scenario app_sql
//   LOAMS_TEST_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8080 node …/record-fixtures.mjs
//
// A body is stored base64 when it is not UTF-8 JSON, so a gRPC-Web frame or a
// Connect streaming envelope replays byte for byte.
