# Runs **one** of a language's six named conformance tests (SDK1 Task 4).

#   sdks/conformance/run-test.sh typescript error_reason_mapping
#   sdks/conformance/run-test.sh typescript conformance_all_required_fixtures
#   sdks/conformance/run-test.sh python  pagination_iterator
#
# The six names are the contract: `conformance_all_required_fixtures`,
# `retry_reuses_idempotency_key`, `error_reason_mapping`,
# `stream_resume_with_cursor`, `token_source_refresh`, `pagination_iterator`,
# each prefixed with the language (`<lang>_<name>`). They are data in
# `required.mjs`, so a runner that accepted a seventh name would make two
# languages incomparable, and this script refuses one.
#
# The corpus is verified **before** the test runs. A suite that passes against a
# corpus with a missing or mislabelled fixture is not a pass, and finding that out
# from the suite's own failure message costs a debugging session every time.
#
# By default the test replays the committed corpus through the fixture server. With
# `--live` it runs against a real `loams dev`, which covers the `loams dev` half
# of the corpus only — the app-mock scenarios have no counterpart there, so a live
# run is a *narrower* run and says so.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 the test failed, 2 this script could not run it.
