#
# `run-all.sh` is the runner for CI: it verifies the corpus, runs the harness
# tests and every language's six tests against the committed recordings, and costs
# no Rust build. **This** script is the other half — it boots `loams dev` and
# `loams-apps-mock` and runs the same suites against them, which is what catches a
# corpus that has drifted from the API. Design §44 §10.4 names the split: CI
# cannot afford to boot a Rust server for each of the thirteen SDKs on every PR.
#
# ## Failing loudly
#
# Three things make this exit non-zero, and all three used to be invisible:
#
# - **A missing required fixture.** The corpus is verified before anything runs,
#   and `verify-corpus.mjs` fails on a `manifest.json` entry with no file behind
#   it. A suite that passes against a corpus with a hole in it is not a pass.
# - **A case the live server answers differently.** `fixtures_pass_against_real_server`
#   replays every `loams dev` case against the server that is actually running.
# - **A recording that has drifted.** `--drift` re-records into a temporary
#   directory and compares, masking only the fields `manifest.json` declares
#   volatile. It never writes to the corpus.
#
# Rust builds are capped at -j 4 on a 15 GB machine. The target directory is not
# set here: the repository's cargo config already sends it outside the tree, and
# hard-coding it would be wrong on any machine that redirects it again.
