// The required-fixture rule (design §44 §10.4, D617).
//
// **This file is the only definition of it.** `run.sh`, `run-test.sh` and
// `run-all.sh` all import this and none of them re-states the rule, because the
// plan's global constraint ("a language cannot skip a required fixture;
// `transport:grpc-only` fixtures skip only on the Connect-unary fallback") has
// already been written down three times in three languages' worth of prose and
// drifted each time. Prose is not enforcement.
//
// ## What the rule is
//
// A language is publishable only when it has run **every** fixture in
// `manifest.json` with `required: true`. There is exactly one permitted skip:
//
//   a fixture marked `transport: grpc-only`, on the Connect-unary fallback
//   transport (D613 — Ruby and PHP hosts without a native gRPC extension).
//
// Everything else fails. In particular:
//
// - a **missing** fixture is a failure, not a warning: a corpus entry with no
//   file behind it means a language is being excused for a test nobody wrote;
// - an **unknown** fixture name in a language's report is a failure, because a
//   typo in a suite that silently reduces coverage is worse than no suite;
// - a fixture the language reports as skipped for any other reason is a
//   failure, whatever the reason text says.
//
// ## How a language reports
//
// A suite writes `sdks/fixtures/results/<language>.json`:
//
//   { "tests": [...], "ran": [...], "skipped": [{ "fixture": "…", "reason": "…" }] }
//
// `ran` is the list of fixture names the suite actually exercised. It is the
// only thing that counts; a test that passes without touching a required
// fixture has not run it. The runner compares `ran` against `required` and
// exits non-zero on the difference.

 * written down so the runner has one place to look — and **the runner refuses to
 * run it**, because a runner that executes a command nobody has executed turns a
 * missing SDK into a confusing CI failure instead of an honest "not wired up
 * yet". Each language's task flips its own flag when its suite is green.
 *
 * The command is `[program, args...]` and is run in `dir`, with the fixture
 * endpoint already in the environment. `-t <name>` filters by test name in every
 * runner this table covers, which is what makes one test runnable in isolation
 * without the other five.
