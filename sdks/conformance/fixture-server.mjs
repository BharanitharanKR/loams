// The conformance fixture server (design §44 §10.4, SDK1 Task 4).
//
// Serves the recorded corpus over real HTTP so an SDK's conformance suite runs
// against something that speaks the wire, with nothing to install but Node. The
// thirteen SDKs all run their suite against this, which is what makes the suite
// comparable between them: same bytes, same status codes, same trailers.
//
//   node sdks/conformance/fixture-server.mjs [--port 0] [--fixtures <dir>]
//
// It prints `{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:PORT"}` on stdout once it is listening,
// then serves until it is killed.
//
// A request that matches no recorded case is a **404 with a body naming the
// gap**, never a silent success. A conformance suite that passed because the
// fixture server answered everything with 200 would be worse than no suite, so
// an unrecorded path fails loudly and the corpus has to grow.
//
// ## Three things it does beyond replaying bytes
//
// **Faults.** A request carrying `loams-test-fault: <name>` gets that fault
// from `faults.mjs` instead of a recording. Faults are the one thing in the
// corpus that is *not* a recording — no healthy server produces a retryable
// `unavailable` on demand — so they are marked as injected everywhere they
// appear, and the server says so in `/__fixtures/faults`.
//
// **Scenario steps.** A single-request fixture is a `method + path + content
// type` lookup, but a *scenario* is an ordered sequence whose steps are often
// byte-identical: the idempotency replay sends the same request twice. Replaying
// step 0 for step 1 would make the second call answer with the first call's
// bytes and prove nothing. So a scenario step is selected by the
// `loams-fixture-step` header, which every language can send and none of them
// has to know about to run the rest of the corpus.
//
// **Streams.** A recorded stream is a bounded prefix, so it is written as the
// frames it is rather than as one buffer: the client sees them arrive one at a
// time, which is the only way a heartbeat or a cursor is observable at all.
