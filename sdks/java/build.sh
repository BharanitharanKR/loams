# The Java SDK's build (SDK2 Task 6, design §44 §9 row 2).
#
#   ./build.sh              # compile and run the whole suite
#   ./build.sh compile      # compile only
#   ./build.sh test         # compile and run
#   ./build.sh test -t name # run the test methods whose name contains `name`
#   ./build.sh stubs        # regenerate sdks/java/gen from proto/ (needs `buf`)
#   ./build.sh package DIR  # the Maven Central files for dev.loams:loams in DIR
#   ./build.sh example      # run examples/notes against LOAMS_ENDPOINT
#   ./build.sh clean
#
# ## Why not Maven or Gradle
#
# Neither is installed on the machines this SDK is developed on, and
# `sdks/conformance/required.mjs` currently names `./gradlew test` for Java. This
# script is therefore plain `javac`/`java` plus `curl`, so a JDK is the only
# requirement. The dependency list is four jars, pinned by version here and
# checksummed below, so a run is reproducible without a resolver.
#
# Switching to Maven or Gradle later is a change to this file and to
# `sdks/java/pom.xml` (or `build.gradle`); nothing under `src/`, `test/` or
# `gen/` has to move, because none of it depends on the build tool.
#
# ## What is generated and what is not
#
#   gen/   **generated** by `protoc-gen-java` from `proto/` via `buf.gen.yaml`
#          (D604). Committed, like Go's `gen/`. `./build.sh stubs` regenerates.
#   src/   hand-written runtime and module surface. `src/dev/loams/facade/` is the
#          Q604 hand-written-facade fallback, because
#          `crates/loams-facade-gen` has no Java renderer.
#   test/  the conformance suite and the runtime-contract tests.

# ## Pinned dependencies
#
# `protobuf-java` is the only runtime dependency the SDK's own code has (asserted
# by `theRuntimeNeedsOnlyProtobuf`). `protobuf-java-util` is here for
# `JsonFormat`, the JSON codec a caller may ask for. `guava` and
# `failureaccess` are protobuf-java's own transitive dependencies and must be on
# the classpath alongside it. JUnit is the test framework, and JUnit 4 is chosen
# over 5 so the suite runs with `org.junit.runner.JUnitCore` off a plain JDK
# with no launcher jar and no module path.
