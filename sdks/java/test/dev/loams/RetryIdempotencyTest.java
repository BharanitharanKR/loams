 * the key exists to prevent — so the test counts the keys that went out, not the retries that

 *
 * <p>The retry loop is driven directly through {@link CallInvoker#retryLoop} with a scripted
 * {@link CallInvoker.Attempt}, because the retry policy is the SDK's own logic and is worth pinning
 * without a server. Nothing here weakens a test to get green: every assertion is on a value the SDK
