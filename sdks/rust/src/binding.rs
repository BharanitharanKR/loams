//! The runtime's view of the **generated** binding table (D641).
//!
//! [`facade`](crate::facade) is emitted by `protoc-gen-loams-facade` and holds
//! **data and traits only**: the enums, the reason constants, `MODULES`, and one
//! trait per service. It carries no lookups, and that is deliberate.
//!
//! `dev`'s `facade.rs` was a hand-written placeholder that mixed the two —
//! generated-shaped data beside hand-written `binding_of`, `module_of`,
//! `ModuleBinding::call` and `CallBinding::rpc` accessors. When the renderer
//! landed, those helpers could have gone *into* the generator, which would have
//! been the smaller diff. It would also have put hand-written code inside a
//! `@generated` file, which is the one thing §44 §10.1 point 3 and
//! `scripts/sdk/drift.sh` exist to prevent: the next regeneration would either
//! drop the helpers or silently keep them, and nobody could tell which from the
//! diff.
//!
//! So the split is by *ownership* rather than by convenience. The generated file
//! owns what the protos say; this module owns how the runtime reads them. Both
//! halves are over the same `facade::MODULES`, so there is one table and one
//! source of truth either way.
//!
//! [`CallBinding::retry_class`] is the one place the two vocabularies meet, and
//! it is where the SDK's retry semantics are pinned — read its comment before
//! changing anything about it.
