"""SDK2 Task 2's `python_error_reason_mapping`.

Design §44 §7.4, D611 and runtime contract R8: a failed RPC carries a Connect
code and one `loams.errors.v1.ErrorInfo`, and **`reason` is what callers branch
on**. The message is for people and may change.

In Python the branch is `isinstance`, so this pins:

- every reason in the registry reaches the SDK as a **type** a caller can assert
  on, not a string comparison, and each one is raised under the code the
  registry says;
- the type comes from the code, so a caller can also branch on the coarse
  category (`NotFoundError` for `not_found`);
- the two reasons that get their own class rather than the code's generic one,
  because they ask for different handling: `token_expired` (refresh and retry)
  and `feature_not_in_variant` (the binary is wrong, not the request);
- a reason from a *newer* server, which this SDK's registry does not have, is
  surfaced rather than dropped -- that is what `unknown_reason` is for;
- a failure from below the API -- a socket, a timeout, a bug in the SDK --
  carries no `reason` at all, which is a different thing from a Loams service
  refusing.

The corpus covers the errors a `loams dev` mock produces; this covers all
twenty-six reasons in the registry, plus the recorded ones over the wire.
