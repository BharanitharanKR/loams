"""SDK2 Task 2's `python_stream_resume_with_cursor`.

R7: a server stream hands out cursors, and a reconnect has to resume from the
last one. Resuming from the beginning instead would silently miss everything
that changed while the client was disconnected, which is the failure this exists
to prevent -- so the cursor, not the message count, is what decides where the
reconnect starts.

Two halves, because they fail differently:

* **Over the wire**, against the recorded `live_watch` fixture: the refusal
  arrives *inside* the Connect streaming envelope with an HTTP 200, so an SDK
  that only looks at the status reports a healthy empty stream. That is a real
  recorded case and `live.watch` is bound, so it runs here.
* **Against a stub**, for the reconnect itself. The corpus's three stream-resume
  scenarios and its heartbeat scenario are all `WatchApprovals`, which no SDK
  binds -- `loams.approvals.v1` carries no `loams.options.v1.module` option, so
  the generator emits no binding and there is nothing to call. They are named in
  `test_conformance_corpus.py`'s account of what cannot be run, rather than here:
  `check-languages.mjs` counts fixtures per language by scanning sources for the
  names in `manifest.required`, so mentioning one here would report it as run.
  A fixture for an RPC the SDK cannot call would test the refusal, not the
  resume, so the resume semantics are driven against a stub here and the corpus
  half waits for a bound RPC.

`Transition` carries no `cursor` field, so the reader and the re-open request are
supplied by the caller -- which is the shape `streams.py` documents for exactly
this case.

    """Rejects a stale bearer once, then streams a message.

    A watch is the one call a client holds open long enough for its credential to
    expire underneath it, so it is the call where "refresh and reconnect" has to
    work. `_mapped`/`_async_mapped` have to notice the refusal *before* the caller
    has seen a message -- so there is nothing to yield yet and nothing to resume
    from.

    The refusal is an HTTP 200 with the error inside an end-stream frame, because
    that is how Connect reports a streaming error and there is no other way to
    report one. Two wrong shapes got tried first, and both failed *silently*
    rather than loudly, which is the note worth keeping:

    - 401 with a framed end-stream: connectrpc does not read frames from a
      non-2xx, so it decoded a bare `UnauthenticatedError` with no reason -- which
      the runtime correctly refuses to refresh against.
    - 401 with `content-type: application/json`: that is the *unary* JSON content
      type, so the streaming client treated the body as one unary response, found
      no `Transition` in it, and returned an empty stream. No exception, no retry,
      one request. A watch that silently ends looks exactly like a healthy watch
      that saw no changes.

    So: 200, `application/connect+json`, and the end-stream payload is the error
    document wrapped as `{"error": {...}}` -- which is a different shape from the
    unwrapped `{"code": ..., "details": [...]}` a unary 401 uses.
