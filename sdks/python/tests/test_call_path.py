"""What a single call carries, and which session it resolves to.

`call_headers` and `resolve_session` decide two things a caller cannot see from
the outside but depends on completely:

- whether their own headers reach the wire at all, and cannot displace the
  credential; and
- whether a read is `STRONG` on its own or joined to a session's token.

Both were unrun. Coverage measured with stdlib `trace --count`, judged per
statement span, put `options.headers` (the whole point of a public
`CallOptions.headers`), the `loams-consistency` header, and every branch of
`resolve_session` at zero.

The header tests go over a real HTTP server rather than calling `call_headers`
directly, because the interesting failures are not in the function. `dict.update`
followed by `headers["authorization"] = ...` is obviously correct in isolation;
what matters is that connectrpc does not drop, reorder or overwrite a header
on its way out, and only a request can show that.
