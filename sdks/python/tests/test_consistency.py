"""Consistency tokens (D609, R4) -- the store, and the gap above it.

The store's own semantics are pinned here, and so is the fact that nothing can
currently feed it. That second half is the point of the file.

D609 puts a consistency token in the response **message** and in the response
header `loams-consistency-token`. On this SDK neither path delivers:

* no generated message has a `consistency_token` field, so `record_consistency`
  finds nothing to read; and
* `connectrpc==0.12.1` exposes only `execute_unary` / `execute_server_stream`,
  which hand back the message and drop the response headers, so the header
  cannot be read either -- there is no `call_unary` to ask.

So `session_consistency=True` builds a store that stays empty, attaches no
`loams-consistency` header to any later read, and gives the caller neither
read-your-writes nor an error. The Rust SDK reads the header
(`token_from_headers`); this SDK cannot yet, and that is a dependency limit
rather than a missing feature.

`test_a_connectrpc_upgrade_that_exposes_headers_should_prompt_the_fix` fails the
moment connectrpc grows a call that returns response headers, which is the
signal to read the token and make the flag do what it says.
