"""The client surface itself: the guards, the properties and the two wirings.

`loams.py` and `aio.py` are described in their own docstrings as "the thin join"
-- they read the generated table, build one object per module, and hand every
call to the same invoker. That is exactly why their untested lines went
unnoticed: nothing in them looks like behaviour.

Coverage measured with stdlib `trace --count` had, on both clients:

- both constructor guards unrun (`api_key` and `auth` together, empty endpoint);
- `consistency`, `proto_rev` and `proto_packages` unrun;
- `binding()` unrun, including its "a module name is required" guard;
- `invalidate_catalogue()` unrun; and
- `paginate()` unrun on both, plus `stream()` on the sync client.

The constructor guards matter most: `pass api_key or auth, not both` is a
misuse error, and an SDK that silently prefers one of two credentials is worse
than one that refuses.

`paginate` cannot be driven end to end because no RPC is paged yet --
`ListCollections` is API1 Task 2, as `Loams.paginate`'s own docstring says -- so
what is pinned here is the refusal, which is the part a caller meets today.
