"""SDK2 Task 2's `python_retry_reuses_idempotency_key`.

D610 and runtime contract R5: a mutation may only be retried when it carries an
idempotency key, and **the same key has to go out on every attempt**. A retry
that mints a fresh key is a second write the server cannot collapse, so the
failure this prevents is a duplicated mutation, not a failed one.

The key travels in the request body (`MutateRequest.idempotency_key`, proto3
`optional`), not as a header, so the server here decodes each attempt's body and
records the key it carried. Asserting a header would have passed against a
server that never saw one.

Pinned:

- every attempt of a retried mutation carries the same key;
- a key the caller supplied is the one that goes out, on every attempt;
- a minted key is a UUIDv7, so keys sort in issue order;
- two logical calls get different keys, or one would be deduplicated against
  the other;
- the caller's message is never mutated -- the key goes on a clone, because the
  same request object gets reused;
- a request whose schema declares no `idempotency_key` is not keyed, and is left
  exactly as the caller wrote it;
- a read retries without a key, because it is `safe`, which is a different reason
  from a mutation being retryable.
