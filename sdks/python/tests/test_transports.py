"""Transport option plumbing, and the two paths that refuse to guess.

`loams.runtime.transports` decides which of Connect / gRPC / gRPC-Web a client
speaks and hands the result to `connectrpc`. Coverage measured with stdlib
`trace --count` showed its error paths unrun -- and an error path is the one kind
of line that only matters when something is wrong, which is exactly when nobody
wants to discover it raises the wrong thing.

So the focus here is the refusals:

- an unknown protocol name lists the ones that exist, rather than a `KeyError`;
- a transport with no base URL says so, rather than handing `None` to
  `connectrpc` and getting an `AttributeError` three frames deeper.

Plus `merge`, whose job is to let a `Loams` fill in its own address while a
caller who set one keeps it, and `headers_of`, which has to preserve the caller's
mapping rather than alias it -- the SDK hands that dict straight to
`connectrpc`, which may keep it.
