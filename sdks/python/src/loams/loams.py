What is generated and what is hand-written, once more, because it decides where a
change goes. The **module surface** is generated: `loams._gen.facade` has one
typed protocol per annotated service, one method per `FacadeOptions` call, and
`MODULES` says which service and which retry class each call has. The **runtime**
behind those methods is hand-written, once, in `loams.runtime/`: transport,
credentials, retry, errors, tokens, pagination, streams. This module is the thin
join — it reads the generated table, builds one object per module out of it, and
hands every call to the same invoker. It contains no method names and no RPC
paths, which is why annotating a proto is enough to add an SDK method.

The async twin is `loams.aio.AsyncLoams`, over the same table and the same
runtime decisions.

            (D609). **Off by default**: every read is then `STRONG` on its own,

            **Turning this on does not yet give you read-your-writes, and nothing
            warns you.** D609 puts the token in the response message *and* in the
            response header `loams-consistency-token`. No generated message has a
            `consistency_token` field, so that half of the contract is not there
            to read; and `connectrpc==0.12.1` exposes only `execute_unary` and
            `execute_server_stream`, which return the message and discard the
            response headers, so the other half is unreachable too. The store
            therefore stays empty and no `loams-consistency` header is ever sent.

            So this is currently a no-op that costs an allocation. It is kept
            because the flag is the documented shape of the feature and the store
            is correct once a token can reach it. `loams.consistency` is `None`
            when the flag is off; with it on, the store is there and
            `loams.consistency.current()` is still `None`, which is how you can
            tell. `tests/test_consistency.py` pins the gap, and fails on a
            connectrpc upgrade that would let us close it.
