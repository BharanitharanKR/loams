"""The Loams SDK for Python.

``from loams import Loams`` is the SDK's front door, so this module re-exports
the clients and the token-source factories. Without it the package installs but
the documented imports fail: Python treats a directory with no ``__init__.py`` as
a namespace package, and a namespace package has none of these attributes.

The token sources are re-exported in matched sync and async pairs because every
one of them has an async twin, and picking the wrong one is a bug that only shows
up as a blocking call on the event loop -- ``aio.py`` had been importing the
sync ``api_key`` under the name ``async_api_key_source``.
