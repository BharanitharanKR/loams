"""Token sources (design §44 §7.4, D608; runtime contract R1).

A token source returns a bearer and can be asked for a new one. Tokens travel in
`Authorization: Bearer` and never in a query string. A `401` carrying
`reason = token_expired` triggers one refresh and one retry; that logic lives in
the call path, so a source stays a source.

Every source here has a sync and an async form, because `Loams` and `AsyncLoams`
are separate objects over one contract and a caller who chose the async one must
not have to block a thread to refresh a token. The two forms of one credential
read the same thing — `api_key(k).token()` and `async_api_key(k).token()` both
answer `k` — and `python_token_source_refresh` pins that they do.

`refresh` is **optional** on a source, which Python's `Protocol` cannot say
directly. `refresh_of` is how the call path asks: it returns the bound method or
`None`, and `None` is what makes a refresh a no-op for a credential that does not
expire. That is R1's "a source that cannot refresh makes the refresh a no-op".
