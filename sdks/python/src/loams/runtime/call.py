"""The call path: the one place a facade method becomes an RPC (design §44 §7.4;
runtime contract R1–R4).

It does four things the generated facade cannot, and nothing else:

- attaches the bearer from the client's token source;
- retries on the call's class **from the generated bindings**, with M1.6's
  backoff numbers, and refreshes the token once on `token_expired`;
- gives a mutating call an idempotency key once per logical call and reuses it
  on every retry, so a retried write is the same write (D610);
- turns whatever is thrown into the typed `LoamsError` hierarchy, so a caller
  branches on `reason` and never on a message.

Both clients share it: `CallInvoker` is the sync path and `AsyncCallInvoker` the
awaitable one, and the retry loop, the key lifecycle and the error mapping are
written once as free functions so the two cannot drift on the parts R1–R4 pin.

        A plain `def` returning the iterator, not an `async def` returning one,
        because that is what the generated `LiveModule.watch` declares --
        `def watch(...) -> AsyncIterator[Transition]` -- and it is what
        `AsyncLoams.stream` passes to `async_watch`. As an `async def` this
        returned a coroutine, so `async for t in client.live.watch(req)` raised
        `TypeError: 'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method, got
        coroutine`, and `AsyncLoams.stream` was broken by the same cause. Neither
        path had ever been run.

        The shape mirrors the sync `stream`: validation stays eager so a bad
        binding fails at the call, and only the token resolution is deferred,
        since that is the one thing that has to be awaited.
