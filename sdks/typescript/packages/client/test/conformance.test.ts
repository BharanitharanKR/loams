// SDK2 Task 0's `typescript_conformance_all_required_fixtures`.
//
// The corpus in `sdks/fixtures` is recorded from a real `loams dev` and from
// `loams-apps-mock`, and this runs every **required** fixture in it through the
// SDK and writes the report the 100% bar is read from (design §44 §10.4, D617).
//
// The rest of the file pins what a client is *for* — a successful call, a
// structured reason, and the unavailable-service path in all three of its shapes
// — through the public facade, which is the surface an application uses. The
// fixture driver beside it answers a different question: not "does the SDK work"
// but "did the suite run every fixture the corpus marks required", and it
// answers it by driving them, so the answer cannot be written down anywhere.
//
// Three things are covered, which between them are what the design asks of a
// conforming SDK:
//
// - a successful call, in every encoding an SDK might pick;
// - a structured-reason error, with `reason` and not the message;
// - the unavailable-service path, in all three of its shapes: the guard that
//   costs no RPC, the refusal a call gets, and the refusal on a stream.
