// Everything the required-fixture driver needs to know about a fixture comes
// from here and from `manifest.json`: where the recording is, what its steps
// were, and what each step has to hold. **Nothing is written down twice** — the

// from the corpus, so a fixture that moves cannot leave the suite asserting the
// old thing.
//
// The two files the corpus is filed under are both walked: `recorded/` is the
// `loams dev` half and `recorded/apps-mock/` the `loams-apps-mock` half, and
// `manifest.json`'s `file` field says which one a fixture is in, so no
// directory is guessed.
