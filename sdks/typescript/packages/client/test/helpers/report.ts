// The conformance report the TypeScript suite writes (design §44 §10.4, D617).
//
// `sdks/fixtures/results/typescript.json` is what
// `check-languages.mjs --check typescript` reads, and until a suite writes one
// that command has nothing to check — which is how the 100% required-fixture bar
// came to be enforced for no language at all, TypeScript included.
//
// ## Generated, never committed
//
// The report is **not** in git, and that is a decision rather than an oversight
// (D640). A committed report is a claim about a corpus, made by a suite, and it
// starts being wrong the moment either moves: `manifest.json` gains a required
// fixture, or the suite stops driving one. Both of those are real regressions,
// and a committed file turns both into a green diff — the suite fails to run, or
// is run with a filter, and CI reads a report that describes the last run that
// happened to write it. `check-languages.mjs` is only a gate if what it reads
// came out of the run in the same breath.
//
// So the suite **generates** it, CI **generate-then-check**, and the file is
// gitignored like every other build output. What stays in git is the thing that
// makes the report trustworthy: the driver that derives `ran` from the corpus it
// really exercised.
//
// ## What may go in it
//
// - `tests` is the suite's own inventory, discovered by looking for each
//   canonical name in this package's test sources. A renamed test drops out of
//   the report instead of being claimed, and `checkLanguage` says which.
// - `ran` is what `driveRequiredFixtures` returned: fixtures whose steps were
//   driven **and held**. It is never a list written down here.
// - `skipped` is empty because the TypeScript suite skips nothing. The one legal
//   skip is a fixture marked `transport: grpc-only` on the Connect-unary
//   fallback (D613), and no fixture in the corpus carries it — this suite speaks
//   gRPC-Web and Connect, so there is nothing to fall back from.
// - `transport` is what the run actually used, which is the field `maySkip`
//   keys off.
