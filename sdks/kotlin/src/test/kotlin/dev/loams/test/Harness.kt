/**
 * The test harness (SDK2 Task 5).
 *
 * ## Why this exists rather than JUnit
 *
 * Three reasons, and the third is the one that matters:
 *
 *  1. **No resolver.** `build.sh` is `kotlinc` plus `java` plus one pinned jar,
 *     because there is no Gradle or Maven on the machines this SDK is developed
 *     on (`build.sh` says so). JUnit 5 would add a launcher jar and a module
 *     path to that list for six test names.
 *  2. **A green run of zero tests is the failure mode `run-test.sh` already had
 *     to be taught to distrust.** `D651` records `dotnet test --filter` printing
 *     "No test matches the given testcase filter" and **exiting 0**. A harness
 *     that prints how many tests it ran, and **exits 2 when it ran none**, makes
 *     that class of bug impossible here rather than checked for elsewhere.
 *  3. **A filter that matches nothing is a failure here**, for the same reason. If
 *     somebody renames `kotlin_pagination_iterator` by one character and asks for
 *     the contract name, this runner says so and exits non-zero.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * A test is a named block registered by name. `RunTests` runs every one whose
 * name contains a filter, and reports the failures per test rather than stopping
 * at the first, so one run learns about all of them.
