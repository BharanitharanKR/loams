/**
 * Reading a recorded fixture off disk — the one place the corpus file format is

 *
 * ## Why both roles share it
 *
 * Two things read a recording: the **fixture server**, which replays the bytes it
 * finds, and the **corpus driver**, which replays a call and compares the answer
 * to what the recording says. They agreed before, by having two copies of the
 * same reader, and they stopped agreeing the moment the corpus's `body` stopped
 * being always a string: the server read only the string form and silently
 * served an **empty** body for every recorded Connect refusal, so the driver
 * compared a `failed_precondition` the server never sent. A disagreement between
 * what a suite thinks the corpus says and what it was served is the most
 * expensive kind of bug in a conformance harness, so there is one reader.
 *
 * ## The corpus's `body` is a string *or* an object
 *
 * A recorded body is the bytes the server actually sent, and the recorder wrote
 * it as parsed JSON rather than as a string when it was JSON. Both forms are in
 * `sdks/fixtures`: `mock_error_approval_expired` records `request.body` as the
 * string `{"approvalId":"…"}` and `response.body` as an object, while
 * `live_watch` records both as `bodyBase64`. An object body is therefore
 * re-serialized to recover its bytes, and a body that is neither is empty rather
 * than an error — a recording with no body is a recording of an empty body.
