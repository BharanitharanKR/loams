/**
 * The corpus driver: it replays `sdks/fixtures` through the SDK and reports what
 * it actually ran.
 *
 * # Why the driver derives its coverage rather than listing it
 *
 * `sdks/conformance/required.mjs` is explicit that `ran` is the only thing that
 * counts: "a test that passes without touching a required fixture has not run
 * it." A hand-written list of fixture names would be a second source of truth that
 * could name a fixture the suite stopped replaying, and the gate would pass on it —
 * so the list here is read from `manifest.json` at run time, the fixture is
 * **replayed**, and the name goes into `ran` only once the recorded response and
 * the recording's own `expect` block have both been checked. A fixture the driver
 * could not reach is therefore absent from `ran` and the gate says so by name.
 *
 * The same rule governs every other decision in here. Which call a step is driven
 * through, whether its idempotency key is minted, and where a named response field
 * lives are all asked of the **schema** — the RPC path, the request and response
 * descriptors — and never of a fixture's name. A rule written as a list of names
 * stops tracking what the driver did the moment the corpus grows.
 *
 * # Why the mock fixtures need no facade
 *
 * The 13 `mock_*` fixtures sit on `ApprovalService` and `DeviceService`, which
 * carry **no** `loams.options.v1.module` annotation — so the corpus has no facade
 * for them, and `Facade.modules` does not list them. They are driven through the
 * same generic `CallInvoker.unary` every facade method delegates to, with the
 * binding resolved from the **service descriptor** the RPC path names. There is no
 * table here to add a fixture to, and nothing to fall out of step with the corpus.
 *
 * # What a fixture run asserts
 *
 * Everything the recording states about itself, and nothing it does not:
 *
 *  - the **request** is byte-identical to the recording, because
 *    `fixture-server.mjs` answers 400 otherwise — which is what proves the SDK
 *    encoded what the corpus recorded rather than something equivalent;
 *  - the **outcome** matches `expect`: the HTTP status as the SDK saw it, the
 *    `reason`, the `grpcStatus`, and the response fields the recording names;
 *  - `identicalToStep` means the **SDK's own** two answers are the same bytes. It
 *    is not a comparison of the recording against itself, which would hold for a
 *    driver that never looked at either answer.
