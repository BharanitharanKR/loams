/**
 * What a recording says must be true of the SDK's answer, and the reader for
 * each of those facts.
 *
 * Split out of `CorpusDriver` so the driver is the thing that *replays* and this
 * is the thing that *judges*: a failure in here is a disagreement about what the
 * recording claims, and a failure in the driver is a disagreement about what got
 * sent. One file with both makes a red run ambiguous.
 *
 * # Every field is read out of the descriptor, never off a generated property
 *
 * The corpus names response fields in proto3 JSON (`apiVersions`, `snapshotReset`)
 * and the descriptors are proto3, so the **JSON name** is the one the corpus and
 * `fixture-server.mjs` agree on. That is also why an enum is compared **by name**
 * and a 64-bit integer **as a string**: an enum is a number in memory and a name
 * in the recording, so comparing the number would pass for every approval state in
 * the proto and fail for every reason that matters.
 *
 * # A field named in `expect` may live one level down
 *
 * `mock_state_idempotent_decide` records `expect.state` and `expect.revision` for a
 * `DecideApprovalResponse`, and neither is a field of that message — they are
 * fields of the `approval` it wraps. A reader that looks only at the top level
 * reports "the response has no state" against a response that plainly has one.
 *
 * So the lookup is: the response's own descriptor first, then the first singular
 * message field of the response — in field-number order, which is the order the
 * proto declares them — that declares the wanted name. That is derived from the
 * response message, never from a list of wrapper field names, so a new response
 * that wraps its subject differently is handled by the same rule (D654).
