// SDK2 Task 7's conformance suite, in the six names the plan states.
//
// The corpus in `sdks/fixtures` is recorded from a real `loams dev` and a real
// `loams-apps-mock`, and this replays every required case in it through the SDK's
// **public surface** — `client.Instance`, `client.Tables`, `client.Approvals` — rather
// than through internals. That is the point: it proves the facade dispatches to the
// right RPC, sends the encoding the corpus recorded, and turns what comes back into
// the right typed value.
//
// Four things are covered, which between them are what design §44 §10.4 asks of a
// conforming SDK:
//
//   - a successful call, in each of the four encodings a client might pick;
//   - a structured-reason error, with `reason` and not the message;
//   - the unavailable-service path, in all three of its shapes: the guard that costs
//     no RPC, the refusal a call gets, and the refusal on a stream;
//   - the runtime clauses with no fixture of their own — retry, idempotency, tokens,
//     pagination, stream resume — pinned against a stub, because the servers today
//     cannot produce those answers on demand (R2, R4, R6).
//
// # C#, and the names of the tests
//
// `sdks/conformance/required.mjs` greps this suite's **source** for the six names
// verbatim, and `run-test.sh` passes one of them to `dotnet test --filter`. xunit
// imposes no naming convention, so each name is a C# method named exactly as the
// runner states it:
//
//     dotnet test --filter csharp_conformance_all_required_fixtures
//
// `csharp_conformance_test_names_exist` asserts the set cannot shrink, so "the six
// tests exist" is a checkable claim rather than a comment.
