// The `ErrorInfo.reason` registry (design §44 §7.4, D611; runtime contract R8).
//
// A failed RPC carries a Connect code and one `loams.errors.v1.ErrorInfo` in its
// details. The **code** gives the class and the **`reason`** is the branch: a
// stable `snake_case` string, registered in `docs/api/reasons.md` and never
// renamed within an API major version. A caller branches on `Reason`, never on
// the message, which may change.
//
// The enum is the registry in the only form C# can make exhaustive: a `switch`
// over it is checked by the compiler, and a reason the registry adds later is a
// value a caller cannot have handled without a warning. Three states are
// deliberately distinct rather than collapsed (R8):
//
//   - `Reason.None` — the failure came from **below the API** (a socket, a
//     timeout, a cancelled token) or the server sent no `ErrorInfo`. It carries
//     no reason, which is not the same thing as any reason in the registry;
//   - a reason off the registry, from a server newer than this SDK: it is
//     surfaced as the **text** in `LoamsError.UnknownReason` rather than
//     dropped, because dropping it leaves a caller unable to tell "not
//     supported here" from "not supported at all";
//   - a reason in the registry, which is `LoamsError.Reason`.
//
// # Provenance
//
// Hand-written, and it is the same hand-written answer `sdks/go` and `sdks/java`
// give: design §44 §7.3's **Q604 fallback**, which permits a hand-written
// facade checked by the same conformance suite where the generator is too costly
// for a language. The C# renderer does not exist in
// `crates/loams-facade-gen`, and this file is the module surface's half of that
// fallback (see `Facade.cs` for the other half).
//
// The list is transcribed from `docs/api/reasons.md`, and
// `csharp_error_reason_mapping` reads that page and fails on a drift, so this
// enum cannot quietly fall behind the registry. **Do not add a reason here
// without adding its row to that page first**: the registry's rule is that a
// reason is registered before an RPC returns it.
