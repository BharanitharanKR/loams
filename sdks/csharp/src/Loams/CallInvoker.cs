// The invoker: the call path a facade method delegates to (design §44 §7.4;
// runtime contract R1–R4).
//
// It is the one place a binding and a request message become an RPC, and it does
// four things the generated facade cannot:
//
//   - attaches the bearer from the client's token source, **per attempt**, because
//     R1's refresh has to change it between two attempts of one logical call;
//   - hands the retry class to <see cref="RetryLoop"/>, which applies it with M1.6's
//     backoff numbers and refreshes the token once on `token_expired`;
//   - gives a mutating call an idempotency key **once per logical call** and reuses
//     it on every retry, so a retried write is the same write (R3);
//   - turns whatever comes back into the typed `LoamsError` hierarchy, so a caller
//     branches on a `reason` and never on a message.
//
// # The same message on every attempt
//
// R3 is enforced structurally rather than by convention: the keyed message is
// computed **before** the loop and the sender is handed the same
// <see cref="Attempt.Request"/> value every time. A sender that built its own
// request would be one refactor away from regenerating the key per attempt, which
// is the exact failure the corpus's `mock_state_idempotent_decide` records.
