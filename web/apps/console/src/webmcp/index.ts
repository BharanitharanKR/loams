// The console's WebMCP surface (AP1d Task 1; design §42 §5, D568–D570, D635).
//
// A page registers tools with `document.modelContext`, so an in-browser agent
// calls a function instead of driving the UI. That is an *enhancement*: D568
// requires the console to work identically with the API absent, and D635 makes
// that load-bearing rather than prudent — WebKit's standards position on
// WebMCP is closed and `oppose`, so there is no version of this plan in which
// Safari is assumed to arrive.
//
// Task 1 was detection and the registration seam. Task 2 adds the generation:
// one tool per row of the plugin action registry (`@loams/console-host`,
// D569), so this module knows a tool's *shape* and the registry knows its
// meaning. The stdio MCP server (§30, D289) reads the same rows, which is why
// nothing here re-describes an action.
//
// The enforcement below is the reason this file is small. Every generated
// `execute` is `registry.invoke`, so a generated tool cannot be more permissive
// than the button behind it: the same `decideCall` / `PERMISSIONS` primitives
// decide, and a destructive action is refused unless a gate returns a decision
// from someone other than the requester (§39 §8 rules 1 and 2, D636). Nothing
// here can approve, and nothing here calls the network.
//
// The constraints below are not defensive coding. Each is a rule read off the
// spec's own IDL in Task 0 and recorded in the design, and each one is a way a
// naive implementation fails:
//
// - Registration-time `signal` **unregisters**; it does **not** cancel a call
//   already running. So sign-out needs one abort per registered tool, not one
//   global flag. `WebMcpTools.clear()` keeps a controller per tool for that
//   reason.
// - `exposedTo` entries must each be a *potentially trustworthy* origin, or the
//   whole `registerTool` promise rejects with `SecurityError`. A plaintext
//   `http://` agent origin cannot be listed at all, so a bad entry is a
//   registration failure rather than a silently dropped origin.
// - Access is gated by the `tools` Permissions Policy (default allowlist
//   `['self']`) and rejects with `NotAllowedError` otherwise.
// - A bare registration is same-origin only. That is the secure default, so
//   `exposedTo` is only ever set when the console is deliberately pairing with
//   another origin.
//
// `requestUserInteraction()` is deliberately absent: Chrome's security
// documentation mentions it, but it does not exist in the 2026-10-02 draft, and
// writing against it would be writing against a proposal.
