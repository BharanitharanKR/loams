// The console's WebMCP feature detection, in a real Chrome (AP1d Task 4;
// design §42 §5, D635 and D638).
//
// `test/webmcp.test.ts` covers the module's logic against objects the test
// builds. This file covers the one thing that cannot be built: what a browser
// that actually carries Chrome's WebMCP machinery does to `document.modelContext`.
// That attribute is `[SecureContext]`, so it never exists under jsdom, and a
// jsdom test can only ever prove the console agrees with a fake.
//
// **This file asserts the invariant, not one browser's answer.** Measured
// 2026-10-05, under the same `--enable-features=WebMCPTesting,DevToolsWebMCPSupport`:
//
//   | surface                         | Chrome 149.0.7827.155 | Chrome 154.0.8037.57 |
//   |---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
//   | `document.modelContext`         | absent                | present               |
//   | `navigator.modelContext`        | present               | absent                |
//   | `navigator.modelContextTesting` | present               | absent                |
//
// The availability of the real API moves with the Chrome channel, and the decoy
// moves the other way, so pinning either one would have been a coin flip on the
// runner image. So the load-bearing assertion is: **whatever the browser
// reports, the console agrees with it.** When `document.modelContext` is absent
// that means `not-exposed` and a `register` that resolves `undefined`; when it
// is present, detection is available, `register` returns a handle, and the
// handle's `exposedTo` carries only potentially-trustworthy origins. Both
// directions are asserted; neither is assumed.
//
// Three further properties hold unconditionally, which is what makes the job
// worth running on a channel that keeps moving:
//
//  - the `navigator.modelContext` / `navigator.modelContextTesting` decoys are
//    **never** mistaken for `document.modelContext`. On 149 the decoys are
//    present and the API is not; on 154 the API is present and the decoys are
//    not. Each build therefore rules out one half of that mistake, and the
//    identity check `detection.context === document.modelContext` rules out the
//    other half on any build that has the API;
//  - a plaintext `http://` origin never reaches `registerTool`;
//  - `clear()` is idempotent, one abort per registered tool, and a partial
//    registration failure keeps the working tools.
//
// Every assertion holds whether or not the flags still work. If a future Chrome
// renames the features, this file keeps passing and its diagnostics change —
// the point of the scenario-by-scenario reporting at the top is that a channel
// change is visible in the log rather than only as a red build.
