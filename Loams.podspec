# The `Loams` pod: the Objective-C SDK (sdks/objc), a preview.
#
# It lives at the repository root, like the root Package.swift, because CocoaPods
# resolves source_files against the podspec's directory when linting and against
# the repository root when it fetches the tag, and both must be the same files.
# The sources are the @objcMembers Swift classes SwiftPM builds and tests in
# sdks/objc/Package.swift; Objective-C callers `@import LoamsObjC;`.
# scripts/sdk/sdk-version.py keeps s.version at the release tag;
# sdk-release.yml lints and pushes this file.
