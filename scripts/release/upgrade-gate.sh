# The upgrade gate (design §54 §14, D941; UP1 Task 20): the previous release's
# stack, with fixture data in every product, upgraded to the candidate, checked,
# rolled back and checked again.
#
#   scripts/release/upgrade-gate.sh WORKDIR
#
# The candidate is the newest release of release/upgrade-path.toml and the
# previous release its `from`. The script downloads the previous release's
# compose bundle (gh, GH_TOKEN), starts it with deploy/release/ci/compose.upgrade.yaml
# as compose.override.yaml, writes the fixtures (conformance/upgrade), builds
# the candidate's `loams` image from this checkout (build.sh) under the
# candidate's version, and drives `loams-upgrade`:
#
#   1. upgrade, check every fixture, write one new item per product, check it;
#   2. rollback from the snapshot; the fixtures read as written, the new items
#      are gone;
#   3. when every migration of the step is Reversible: upgrade again, write
#      new items, `rollback --keep-writes`: the previous release reads the
#      fixtures and the new items (the reversibility check).
#
# WORKDIR gets state.json, check.json, upgrade-*.json, rollback-*.json,
# timings.json and every service's logs. Containers and volumes are the
# compose project's (COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, default `loams`); `down -v` at the end.
