"""Generate and check Loams Flow's connector registry (CN1 Task 2).

Sources of truth, and what each one fixes:

  docs/design/33-connectors.md Appendix A   the 205-row matrix (D352, D358, D628, D634, CN-R1)
  docs/design/33-connectors.md section 8    the 21 starred connectors and their runtime (§8, D358)
  connectors/schema/connector.schema.json   the manifest shape and the category/priority/status enums (CN1 Task 1)
  connectors/registry/catalog.csv           the one CSV the registry is generated from (CN1 Ruling 1)

Modes:

  --check         cross-check Appendix A, section 8, the CSV, every manifest's config.$ref,
                  the manifest ids in connectors/registry/handwritten.txt and the licence gate
                  input, print every disagreement and exit non-zero. This is what CI runs.
  (default)       write connectors/registry/<id>.yaml stubs for every CSV row that has no
                  hand-written manifest, and connectors/schemas/<id>.config.json for every row
                  that has no hand-written config schema. Never overwrites an id listed in
                  handwritten.txt.
  --write-csv     (re)write connectors/registry/catalog.csv from Appendix A.
  --docs PATH     render Appendix A's Markdown tables from the CSV (CN1 Task 14's catalog page).
  --validate      validate connectors/registry/*.yaml against the JSON Schema, using the
                  `jsonschema` module when it is installed.
  --licence-gate-test
                  run the D359 gate against synthetic component tables and assert its two
                  verdicts: a refused id on a `kind = "library"` row is refused, and the same
                  id on a `kind = "service"` row is the D359 carve-out and is accepted
                  (CN1 Task 15's `itsplane` stanza is that second case). Exit non-zero on a
                  wrong verdict.

Deterministic and idempotent: rows are emitted in Appendix A order, files are written only
when their content changes, and two consecutive runs leave `git status` untouched.

Rules this file encodes, with the authority for each:

  * one CSV, hand-written YAML for the 21 starred manifests and for A.18's three Loams
    applications, generated `status: planned` stubs for the rest (CN1 Ruling 1, D628);
  * every manifest's `config.$ref` must resolve to a file under connectors/ (D353: the
    manifest declares the shape of an instance's settings; connector.schema.json requires
    `config`), so a generated stub gets a generated placeholder config schema rather than a
    dangling reference;
  * `starred` follows §8, which is the authority on the starred set; an Appendix A row
    marked P1 that §8 does not list is reported, not silently promoted. A.18's three rows
    are P1 and unstarred by decision (D628, CN1 Task 15, CN1 Ruling 11): they build in CN1
    and D358's 21 is unchanged, so they are listed in ACKNOWLEDGED_NOT_STARRED;
  * a non-starred row runs on Camel when its Camel cell names a component, else on an
    OpenAPI-generated native connector (Ruling 1; §5's `openapi` row). A.18's three are the
    exception: Camel 4.22.1 has no component for any of them, so CN1 Task 15 pins them to
    native Rust in loams-flow (D628). Kestra is a companion, never a runtime (D354, Q356);
  * CN2 Task 2 (OR-1, OR-4): every P1 and P2 row's runtime comes from NATIVE_FIRST (or §8's
    STARRED_RUNTIME), native in each declared direction unless a `fallback-only:` note names
    an OR-4 reason; P1/P2 stubs declare their directions, profiles and fallbacks, and the
    profile placeholders under connectors/profiles/ are written beside them;
  * every licence id in connectors/licences.toml must be an SPDX id outside the refused set
    (D359; CN1 Global Constraints; the licence_gate_refuses_flagged test), with the carve-out
    that the deny list gates what Loams ships or links: a `kind = "service"` row is an API
    surface reached over HTTP, so a refused id on one is accepted and reported as a note.
