"""Read and render Appendix A of `docs/design/33-connectors.md`.

CN1 plan Task 2 makes the design doc's appendix a generated artefact:
`connectors/registry/catalog.csv` holds Appendix A's 200 rows (plan Ruling 1)
and the renderer in `matrix.py` must reproduce the appendix byte for byte, so
`camel_catalog.py` and `kestra_catalog.py` also read the appendix through this
module and see exactly the rows the renderer would produce.

Two directions live here:

* `parse` reads the tables out of the design doc. That is what the two drift
  scripts check against Camel's and Kestra's own catalogs (design §33 risk
  CN-R1: "the Camel and Kestra columns are regenerated from their catalogs").
* `render` writes the same text back out of registry rows, so `--check` can
  diff the two.

Everything here is stdlib-only, like the other scripts under `scripts/`.

ItPlane's upstream is AGPL-3.0 and Forgejo's is MIT; both are read as API surfaces, and `connectors/licences.toml` records that explicitly rather than leaving it implicit. Forgejo's write capability is a **provisioning** fact, not a code fact: Forgejo derives the token scope from the HTTP method, so a `write:issue` token must be minted before the sink can run (its read scopes and its write scopes cannot live in one token).",
