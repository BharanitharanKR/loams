# A generation difference must be a deliberate act — a line in
# `scripts/sdk/pins.lock` and the regenerated output in the same PR — and never
# whatever the runner happened to have. This fails when:
#
#   1. a `remote: buf.build/<owner>/<plugin>:<ref>` in any buf template does not
#      match the version in the lock file;
#   2. a `remote:` reference is not an exact pin (no ref at all, `latest`, or a
#      pre-release), because an unpinned reference resolves to whatever is newest
#      on the day it runs;
#   3. a buf template references a plugin the lock file does not list, so a new
#      tool cannot arrive unpinned;
#   4. a library pin the lock file records (npm, PyPI, go.mod, Cargo.toml) has
#      moved away from the locked version, or has been loosened to a range;
#   5. a lock row has no integrity, because "pinned" without one is a version
#      and not a pin.
#
# buf publishes no digest for a protoc plugin, so a `bsr` row's integrity is the
# plugin's *upstream* version — the `protoc-gen-*` release the BSR build wraps.
# That is the strongest pin buf offers for a remote plugin, and it is checkable
# by reading the plugin's own release notes. Every other kind carries a real
# hash from its registry, and `--refresh` re-fetches those.
