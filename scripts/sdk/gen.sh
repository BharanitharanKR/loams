# first and points buf at wherever cargo put it: the repository's cargo config
# sends build output outside the tree, so the path cannot be committed in the
# template, and buf does not expand environment variables in a `local:` plugin
# path. So the script substitutes it into a copy of the template.
#
# CI runs this and fails on a diff (SDK1's global constraint: generated code is
# never hand-edited). `scripts/sdk/drift.sh` is the CI-side wrapper; this script
# is the developer-side one, and the two run the same steps in the same order.
