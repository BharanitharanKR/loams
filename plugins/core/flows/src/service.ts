/**
 * The cordis service that renders a `graph` widget.
 *
 * Structurally this is `charts`'s `RenderService` with a
 * different terminal value, and it is a deliberate mirror rather than a
 * near-copy: both declare `static inject = ["data", "chartSpecs"]`, both fetch
 * through `ctx.data.fetchWidgetData`, and both resolve their theme through
 * `ctx.chartSpecs.resolveWidgetTheme` instead of reading `widget.chartSpec.theme_spec` or
 * `dashboardSpec.theme` themselves. That precedence is documented at length in
 * `dashboard-spec.ts` and a per-widget override WINS over the dashboard default,
 * so re-implementing it here would be a second copy free to drift.
 *
 * What differs is everything downstream of the theme: ECharts ends in an options
 * object, this ends in a `{ nodes, edges }` pair. That is why `graph` is a
 * sibling `Widget.type` and not a `ChartSchema.kind`, and why
 * `charts` declines a graph widget rather than guessing a chart
 * kind for it.
 *
 * The theme path degrades at every step. A graph tile that renders in the
 * dashboard's own colours is strictly better than a tile that throws and shows an
 * error, so an unresolvable theme, a throwing resolver and a missing chart-specs
 * service all land on `DEFAULT_FLOW_THEME` with a log line, exactly as the
 * echarts service lands on unthemed options.
