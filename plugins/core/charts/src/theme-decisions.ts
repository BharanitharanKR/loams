/**
 * chart-specs `DesignDecisions` -> ECharts option keys.
 *
 * flint-chart's visual theming is realized by its Vega-Lite assembler only; its
 * ECharts assembler accepts a `theme_spec` and discards it. This module is the
 * missing half of that contract for the ECharts path.
 *
 * The seam is deliberately the *grounded* theme, not the authored one. A
 * `ThemeSpec` is level 1: it states ink and policy without binding any of it to
 * a chart. `groundTheme` turns it into `DesignDecisions` - level 2, still
 * backend-neutral, but with every role bound to this chart. Reading the spec
 * directly would mean re-implementing chart-specs' presence ordinals, its ink
 * borrowing chain and its accessibility rules, and getting them subtly wrong.
 * So this module consumes decisions and never a spec.
 *
 * Rules this module holds to:
 *
 * 1. Pure and copy-on-write. The input option object is never mutated; new
 *    objects are constructed along each written path, and untouched subtrees
 *    keep their identity so "no theme says anything here" stays a true no-op.
 * 2. Never invents ink. Every write is gated on a decision actually naming a
 *    colour. Silence yields an option tree deeply equal to the input.
 * 3. Colours and the presence flags that belong to them, and nothing else. This
 *    is an ink bridge: no font sizes, no rotation, no padding. Structural chart
 *    chrome belongs to the compiler and to the card that renders it.
 * 4. No runtime dependency on `echarts`; only structural option types are used.
 *
 * Precedence: this is an overlay applied *after* compilation, because a theme
 * that silently lost to a compiler default is exactly the failure mode this
 * module exists to remove.

 * - `series.status.*` and `series.mode: 'status'` - which series is "positive" is
 *   a semantic judgement no option tree carries. Applying a status ink
 *   positionally would colour series by order, which is a lie.
 * - `series.overflow` as a *tail* - ECharts cycles `color` modulo its length, so
 *   an appended tail ink would collide with the core palette instead of
 *   extending it. It is appended as one more name instead.
 * - `text.inverse` - nothing in this tree is guaranteed to sit on the house's
 *   canvas colour, so inverse text could be unreadable.
 * - `dataLabels.show` / `possible` - grounding answers a density question that
 *   needs a banded axis, which this path does not supply. Imposing the answer
 *   would erase labels the house would have drawn.
 * - `facets`, `layout`, `furniture`, `statistics`, `title.*`, `pointEmphasis`,
 *   `marks.point/outline/connector/interval/summary/reference/observations`,
 *   `axes.zeroRule`, `axes.unit`, `interaction.tooltipFormat` - no unambiguous
