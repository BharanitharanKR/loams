/**
 * Shared HTTP client for upstream analytics services.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every upstream this project talks to — the BI backend, Zulip, Forgejo, Langfuse,
 * OpenPanel, Glitchtip, Matomo — is a separate product with its own auth scheme,
 * its own error shape, and its own pagination convention. Written naively,
 * each adapter re-implements token caching, `Authorization` header assembly,
 * query-string array encoding, and error normalization, and the sixth copy is
 * where the subtle bug lands: one adapter forgets to refresh a token, another
 * encodes a repeated query param with `join(',')` when the API wants it
 * repeated, a third swallows a 403 into a `null` result.
 *
 * Those differences are real and belong in each adapter. The mechanics around
 * them do not. This module owns the mechanics.
 *
 * RESPONSE HEADERS
 * ----------------
 * Some upstreams put load-bearing data in headers, not in the body — Zulip's
 * throttling budget, Forgejo's totals, all of GlitchTip's pagination. So
 * `request` accepts an optional `onResponse` observer and hands out the live
 * `Response` before the body is read. Without it the client would have to
 * discard the response, and every adapter needing a header would have to build
 * its own `fetch` to get one back.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A CORDIS SERVICE
 * ---------------------------------
 * A cordis service is a singleton per container, but each adapter needs its OWN
 * client with a different base URL and credentials. Making this a service would
 * force all adapters to share one misconfigured client. Adapters instantiate it
 * directly instead.

 * - Called BEFORE the body is read, so `res.bodyUsed` is false and headers are

 * - Not called when there was no response at all: a timeout (408), a DNS or
