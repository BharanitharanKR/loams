 * Approach: data-URI `<img>`. These `icon` strings are complete SVG documents
 * from the server, and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` would inject them into the
 * live DOM of the host page — that runs their `<script>`, their event handler
 * attributes and any `<foreignObject>` markup with the page's full privileges.
 * A `data:image/svg+xml` URI in an `<img>` is rendered as an image instead:
 * script in an `<img>`-loaded SVG does not execute, external references are not
 * fetched, and the document cannot reach back into this page. It also keeps the
 * content out of the accessibility tree as markup while `alt` carries the
 * meaning.
 *
 * The trade-off is that the image is opaque to CSS and to theming, which is
 * acceptable for a fixed 16px swatch. Anything that needs to react to the
 * dashboard theme draws its own SVG instead.
 *
 * If a preset arrives with an empty or unparseable icon, the fallback keeps the
 * grid legible rather than showing a broken-image glyph.
