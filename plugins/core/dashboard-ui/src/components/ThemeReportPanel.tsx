 * Surfaces chart-specs' `report` and its invalid-theme error.
 *
 * chart-specs deliberately does not swallow downgrades — "silent fallbacks are
 * indistinguishable from bugs" — so this panel does the same. The report is
 * informational and non-blocking: the theme IS applied, chart-specs just had to
 * approximate something. The error state is separate and blocking, because an
 * unknown preset name means chart-specs refused to resolve at all and nothing is
 * being themed; rendering the dashboard as if it were themed would be a lie.
 *
 * Both states are `Alert`: an error and a warning are exactly its variants, and
 * the one accent it needs is a leading icon plus a two-line slot.
