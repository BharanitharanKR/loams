/**
 * The subset of flint-chart's theme API this UI reads and writes.
 *
 * Hand-mirrored from `flint-chart@0.5.1`'s installed typings rather than
 * imported from it. `flint-chart` is not a dependency of `dashboard-ui` (the
 * server owns theme resolution), and pulling a chart compiler into the browser
 * bundle just to name a few interfaces would be the wrong trade. These are
 * structural subsets, so a spec sent here round-trips through the server
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Field meaning, per chart-specs' own typings:
 *  - `resolveThemeSpec` takes a preset name, a ThemeSpec, or a ThemeSpec that
 *    `extends` a preset plus overrides.
 *  - Nested policy objects MERGE; arrays and scalars REPLACE.
 *  - An unknown preset name is an ERROR, never a silent fallback.
