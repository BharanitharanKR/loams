 * CONFIGURATION mistake, and many of the failure modes are silent on the
 * provider's side: some IdPs with no signing key configured sign HS256 without
 * complaining, an unassigned
 * `offline_access` scope is intersected away, and a `redirect_uri` mismatch is
 * not even an error until the browser round-trips. openid-client's own message
 * for these is accurate but cryptic ("no applicable keys found"), which is the
 * worst possible thing to hand somebody who is trying to stand up an IdP.
 *
 * So every one of those is translated here into a message that names the provider
 * setting to change. `AuthConfigError` carries a stable `code` so tests and logs
 * can assert on the diagnosis rather than on prose.
