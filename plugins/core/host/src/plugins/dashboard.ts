/**
 * The dashboard, as a plugin.
 *
 * The dashboard is not special-cased anywhere else in the platform: it is a
 * manifest with `alwaysOn`, pinned to the top of the console, and its skills
 * read the same `ctx.store` / `ctx.dashboard` services the REST routes read.
 * That is deliberate — if the dashboard's skills were implemented by a
 * separate path, they would drift from what the dashboard actually does.
 *
 * `alwaysOn` is load-bearing, not cosmetic: it is what makes the host load it
 * at boot, makes the registry refuse to disable it, and disables its toggle.

/**
 * The `store`/`dashboard` context keys, read defensively.
 *
 * Defensive for a reason that is easy to miss: cordis resolves an inherited
 * context key only on a context that declared it in `inject`, so reading
 * `ctx.dashboard` from the host's context THROWS when the dashboard-spec service
 * is not reachable -- it does not return `undefined`. Every skill below already
 * has a `store` fallback written for the case where `dashboard` is absent, so the
 * fallback is useless unless the probe cannot throw. Each read is therefore
 * guarded independently: `dashboard` missing degrades that skill to the store,
 * it does not take the whole skill down.
