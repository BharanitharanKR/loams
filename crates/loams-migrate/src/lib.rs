//! Loams upgrades, the server side (design §54, UP1).
//!
//! - [`formats`]: the format registry, re-exported from
//!   [`loams_common::formats`], its only definition (D924).
//! - [`stack`]: the stack record, `_system/upgrade/stack` (§54 §4.2), and the
//!   check that this binary reads every format version it names.
//! - [`ledger`]: the migration ledger, the stack record's home and the
//!   migration lease in the `_system` namespace (§54 §6.2).
//!
//! - [`migration`] and [`runner`]: the migration contract and the runner
//!   (plan, run with resume, abandon), checked against [`path`], the release
//!   train of `release/upgrade-path.toml`.
//!
//! - [`startup`]: the startup gate every Loams process runs before it
//!   serves (§54 §4.3).
//!
//! - [`adopt`] and [`migrations`]: `0000-adopt-preview-2`, which recognises
//!   an unstamped preview.2 stack by fingerprint (§54 §5.3).
//!
//! - [`cx`]: the store contexts a migration works through, each with an
//!   expand-then-switch helper (§54 §6.3).
//!
//! Later UP1 tasks add snapshots and restores.
