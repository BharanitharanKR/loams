//! The reactive correctness checker (LV1 plan Task 1; design §20 §14 item
//! 3).
//!
//! [`run_reactive_checker`] runs a seeded [`Workload`] on a store: tables
//! with an index, sessions watching bounded queries over them, and writers
//! inserting, patching and deleting documents, with the workload's
//! disturbances on the way. Every Transition a session receives is applied
//! to a [`ClientState`], and the client's whole state is recorded at the
//! Transition's end. After the run the checker verifies:
//!
//! - **every recorded state equals a fresh snapshot evaluation** of each of
//!   the session's queries at the Transition's `end.ts`. Checking the whole
//!   state, not only the updated queries, makes a missed invalidation that
//!   is never repaired show as a stale state;
//! - **a change reaches the session at the first tick at or after it**. The
//!   checker records every tick of the subscription manager. For
//!   consecutive Transitions of a session at `p` and `e`, a tick `T` with
//!   `p < T < e` must not have a fresh result that differs from the state
//!   at `p`: the change at `T` was then held back to a later tick. An
//!   Outbox merge (or a resume) legitimately skips ticks, but delivers
//!   promptly, so a tick is checked only when `e` arrived more than
//!   [`LATE_BOUND`] after it;
//! - **versions strictly increase** per session (a heartbeat repeats its
//!   version by design, and so may the first Transition of a resumed
//!   session, which re-sends the full results at the client's last
//!   version), and every Transition starts at the client's version;
//! - **every session catches up** with the last commit;
//! - **resumed sessions converge**: a session disconnected mid-run resumes
//!   from its last version and its later states pass the same checks.
//!
//! **What a seed reproduces.** The seed fixes the op mix: each session's
//! queries and each writer's sequence of ops (kind, table, value), drawn
//! from a ChaCha8 stream per writer. It does not fix the interleaving: which
//! op number a writer takes, when ticks fall and when sessions read depend
//! on scheduling. A failing run's [`Report::dump`] holds what is needed to
//! study it: every writer's op log and every session's records.
//!
//! **Deployments** (LV1 plan Task 7). The sessions watch deployed queries,
//! `chk:query` and `chk:get`, served by the checker's own [`BundleLoader`]:
//! deployment version `n` (bundle `checker-v<n>`) answers
//! `{ v: n, r: <the system query's result> }`. A version is deployed before
//! the sessions open; `Deploy` deploys the next version and `Rollback`
//! activates the one before the current one. The subscription manager
//! follows the app's engine, and every fresh evaluation runs the deployment
//! the pointer names at the evaluation's timestamp, so a result of the
//! wrong deployment is a stale result.
//!
//! **Index changes** (LV1 plan Task 9). `AddIndex` deploys the next
//! version with a schema declaring every table with `by_n` and a second
//! index `by_n2` on `n`, which the deploy backfills while the writers run;
//! `DropIndex` deploys one declaring `by_n` alone, which drops `by_n2`.
//! After the run the checker deletes dropped indexes' entries and checks
//! that every table's index entries are exactly those its documents give
//! (no entry missing, none left over).
//!
//! The subscription manager runs with its safety rerun off, so a missed
//! invalidation stays visible instead of being repaired. The report counts,
//! per session, the update-carrying Transitions that arrived while the
//! writers ran, so a run whose sessions only caught up at the end is seen.
