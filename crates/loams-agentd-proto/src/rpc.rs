//! The RPC contract: the handshake, the error reasons and the method table
//! (design §50 §5.4, §7, §8; plan DD1 Tasks 6, 7 and 9).
//!
//! `Hello` is the first call on a connection. A client whose `protocol`
//! differs from [`AGENTD_PROTOCOL`] is answered with an error whose text
//! starts with [`PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`], and the daemon closes the connection.
//!
//! [`METHODS`] lists every method the daemon serves, with its kind, the
//! TypeScript names of its params and result, the role it needs and whether
//! the renderer may call it through preload. The same table generates the
//! method-name constants ([`methods`]) and one marker type per method
//! ([`calls`]) that ties the name to its Rust params and result types, so
//! the server parses and replies with exactly the types the TypeScript
//! client is generated from.
