//! `loams.collection.v1` `DocumentService` on the main port (design §44 §4 and
//! §7.2, ruling 4; API1 Task 3), against the real `loams` server over its
//! `--listen` address.
//!
//! Every test here is a port of a REST test in `crates/loams/tests/it/`, by
//! its name with an `_rpc` suffix, or a test the API1 plan names outright
//! (`write_idempotency_key_replays_same_token`, `consistency_at_least_waits`).
//! The behaviour is the REST behaviour: the handlers call the same
//! `CollectionService` traits (`write`, `get_with_token`, `scroll_with_token`,
//! `count_with_token`, `delete_by_filter`, `patch_by_filter`), only the shape
//! of the call changed.
//!
//! ## How these tests reach the RPCs
//!
//! Nothing here names a generated Rust type: a compile error is not a red test,
//! and it is how the first draft of this file failed to build at all (it
//! formatted a `serde_json::Map` with `{got}`, which has no `Display`, so the
//! file never ran). Every RPC is a Connect unary `POST` of JSON to
//! `/<package>.<Service>/<Method>` over `reqwest`, the shape `curl` sends
//! (design §44 §4), and every answer is read as `serde_json::Value`. The paths
//! are spelled out as constants at the top of this file, so moving the service
//! between packages is a change in one place — which is how it moved out of the
//! `loams.document.v1` §44 never mentions and back into `loams.collection.v1`.
//!
//! ## Seeding data
//!
//! Collections and namespaces exist as RPCs (`loams.collection.v1`, Task 2),
//! so they are created here over `CreateCollection`. Documents can only be
//! written by `DocumentService/WriteDocuments`, so every document in this file
//! is written by the RPC under test — deliberately none over the native REST
//! route, which would let a test pass while `WriteDocuments` is broken. The
//! REST routes survive until Task 9; this is the round trip Task 2 could not
//! port, and here both halves of it are the RPC.
//!
//! ## The wire shapes this file pins
//!
//! Design §44 §5.1 moves resource names out of the URL and into the request
//! message, and proto3 JSON renames `snake_case` to `lowerCamelCase`, so a
//! REST key becomes a camelCase key here (`report_existence` is
//! `reportExistence`, `max_rows` is `maxRows`, `rows_remaining` is
//! `rowsRemaining`). Every field name this file sends or expects is in the
//! module's report to the implementer; the decisions a reader could have made
//! differently are marked **WIRE** below.
//!
//! Three REST assertions have **no** proto3 JSON spelling, and are dropped or
//! weakened rather than faked:
//!
//! - **Unknown fields are ignored, not refused.** `{"patch": {}}` on a delete,
//!   `{"delete": {"id": …, "source": …}}` and `{"partitons": 2}` were `400` on
//!   REST because the handlers are `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. proto3
//!   JSON says to ignore them, so they are replaced by the refusals that *do*
//!   survive it: a body that is not JSON, and a known field of the wrong JSON
//!   type.
//! - **`null` for a missing document.** proto3 JSON has no `null` for an
//!   element of a `repeated` field of messages. A missing id answers an **entry
//!   with no `id`** (**WIRE**), which is the same information: the entry is
//!   there, in the requested id's position, and carries no `id`.
//! - **Field insertion order.** `documents[0]`'s `id` stayed first and the
//!   source's keys came back in the order they were written because of a serde
//!   insertion-order rule (M1.3 row E58). proto3 JSON orders a message's
//!   fields by field number and a `Struct` by its map iteration order, so the
//!   *ordering* assertion is dropped; the *content* assertion — every key the
//!   write put in the source is in the answer — is kept and is exact.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — the shapes a reader could have made differently
//!
//! These are decisions, not accidents. An implementer who changes one of them
//! changes this file, not the other way round.
//!
//! - **A document id is a typed oneof, not a `google.protobuf.Value`.** A
//!   `Value` holds numbers in a `double`, so the fixture's `u64::MAX` id
//!   (`18446744073709551615`) would come back as `18446744073709552000`. So
//!   `DocumentId` is a oneof of `uint` / `string` / `uuid`, whose proto3 JSON is
//!   `{"uint": "1"}` / `{"string": "k-str"}` / `{"uuid": "0190f5c4-…"}`. The
//!   `uuid` arm is the REST spelling unchanged; the other two are named
//!   because a bare JSON `1` has no oneof spelling.
//! - **A document's `source` is a `google.protobuf.Struct`.** A document's
//!   source is arbitrary caller JSON with a new key per document, so it is the
//!   same case as a collection's schema (ruling 2.1): a `Struct` keeps the
//!   REST source JSON exactly. **Dense and sparse vectors follow the same
//!   rule for the same reason**: `map<string, google.protobuf.Value>` answers
//!   `{"embedding": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]}` byte for byte, and a patch's
//!   `{"embedding": null}` — which removes the vector — is representable at
//!   all only because the value is a `Value` rather than a `ListValue`. A
//!   typed `Document` would renumber every one of these and break every caller
//!   that posts the REST shape today.
//! - **`filter` is a `google.protobuf.Value`, not the typed IR.** The typed
//!   filter IR is **Task 4**; until it lands, `filter` is the native query
//!   JSON verbatim (`{"term": {"field": "tenant", "value": "c"}}`,
//!   `"match_all"`).
//! - **`select` is a `google.protobuf.Struct`**, carrying the REST projection
//!   JSON verbatim (`{"source": "all" | "none" | {"include": [], "exclude":
//!   []}, "vectors": [], "fields": []}`). `source` has a JSON object form that
//!   a `string` cannot hold.
//! - **`Patch.mode` is a `string` carrying the REST spelling** (`merge_deep`,
//!   `merge_top`, `replace`; absent is `merge_deep`), following the precedent
//!   `loams.collection.v1` set for `ScanColumn.role` and
//!   `ScanColumn.distance`. It is only ever *sent*, never read, so a string
//!   costs nothing and keeps a switchable spelling verbatim.
//! - **An answer-side enum is asserted by value, not by spelling.** The write
//!   `results` and the backpressure `state` are proto enums, and `enum_is`
//!   accepts any spelling that ends in the value's `UPPER_SNAKE` name, so the
//!   enum's numbering and its prefix stay the implementer's choice.
//! - **Consistency travels as a request field** (`consistency.atLeast`,
//!   `consistency.freshness`, `consistency.pin`) and comes back in **both** the
//!   `loams-consistency-token` response header and the body (`token` on a
//!   write, `readToken` on a read).
//! - **Backpressure override stays a request header** (`loams-backpressure:
//!   off`) and the backlog stays response headers (`loams-unapplied-records`,
//!   `loams-unapplied-bytes`), because that is the REST behaviour and the
//!   response half is headers by rule.
//! - **`index`, `matched`, `limit`, `retry_after_ms`, `kind` and `name` ride
//!   in `ErrorInfo.metadata`**, which `loams.errors.v1` types as
//!   `map<string, string>` and which `docs/api/reasons.md` already promises
//!   for `resource_exhausted`, `invalid_argument` and `not_found`. Every
//!   reason asserted here is already a registry row; this task adds none.
