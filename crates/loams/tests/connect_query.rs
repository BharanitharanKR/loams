//! `loams.collection.v1` `QueryService/Search` on the main port (design §44
//! §4 and §5.1, API1 plan ruling 1; `docs/api/route-map.md` line 57), against
//! the real `loams` server over its `--listen` address.
//!
//! Every test here is a port of a REST test in `crates/loams/tests/it/` by
//! its name with an `_rpc` suffix, or a test the API1 plan names outright
//! (`scroll_streams_pages_with_cursor`), or an invariant this file pins on its
//! own. The behaviour is the REST behaviour: the handler calls the same
//! `CollectionService::search` the REST handler calls, only the shape of the
//! call changed.
//!
//! ## How these tests reach the RPCs
//!
//! Nothing here names a generated Rust type: a compile error is not a red
//! test, and it is how the first draft of this file (and of
//! `connect_documents.rs`) failed to build at all. Every RPC is a Connect
//! unary `POST` of JSON to `/<package>.<Service>/<Method>` over `reqwest`,
//! the shape `curl` sends (design §44 §4), and every answer is read as
//! `serde_json::Value`. The path is one constant at the top of this file, so
//! the package stays the design's: **`loams.collection.v1`**.
//!
//! Every `{got}` in this file formats a type that implements `Display`
//! (a `serde_json::Value`, a `&str`, a `String`, a number); every `{got:?}`
//! formats a map, a vector or a set, which is the correction the previous
//! draft of this task needed.
//!
//! ## Seeding data
//!
//! Collections and namespaces exist as RPCs (`loams.collection.v1`, Task 2)
//! and documents as `DocumentService/WriteDocuments` (Task 3), so **every**
//! document in this file is written by an RPC: the `kb` and `sp` fixtures are
//! created over `CreateCollection` and written over `WriteDocuments`,
//! deliberately none over the native REST routes, which would let a test pass
//! while the RPCs are broken. The REST route is used in exactly two places,
//! and both are the *point* of the test: `routing_and_ranking_match_rest_for_every_fixture`
//! runs the same fixture through both surfaces, and
//! `loams_hot_used_is_none_without_a_hot_tier_and_off_is_honoured_rpc`
//! checks the one header a REST reader of the hot layer still uses.
//!
//! ## The central assertion: the RPC **equals** REST
//!
//! `routing_and_ranking_match_rest_for_every_fixture` runs each fixture's
//! **same body** through `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/query` and through
//! `QueryService/Search` and compares the two answers **against each other**,
//! never against a hardcoded expectation: the ids, their order, their scores,
//! their sources and their totals. That is the test that fails if a filter, a
//! retriever, a fusion or a sort key silently degrades on one surface — and
//! it fails with a diff rather than with a stale golden number.
//!
//! Every other test keeps the REST suite's own hardcoded expectations, so a
//! *change* to ranking on both surfaces at once is still caught.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — `snake_case` → `lowerCamelCase`: the mapping table
//!
//! The REST IR is serde `snake_case`; **proto3 JSON is `lowerCamelCase`**, and
//! that is an unavoidable divergence between the two surfaces. These are the
//! names this file sends and expects. A key with no `_` in it is the same
//! word on both surfaces and is not in the table; a key with a `_` in it that
//! is **not** in this table fails [`camel`] at runtime, so the table cannot
//! drift away from the fixtures.
//!
//! | REST (`SearchRequest`, the IR) | RPC (`SearchRequest`) |
//! |---|---|
//! | `collection` | `collection` (also spelled `from`, see below) |
//! | `consistency` | `consistency` (the `Consistency` message, Task 3) |
//! | `retrievers` | `retrievers` (also spelled `retrieve`, see below) |
//! | `fusion` | `fusion` (also spelled `fuse`, see below) |
//! | `filter` | `filter` |
//! | `sort` | `sort` |
//! | `offset` | `offset` |
//! | `limit` | `limit` |
//! | `search_after` | `searchAfter` |
//! | `score_threshold` | `scoreThreshold` |
//! | `select` | `select` (a `Struct` projection, Task 2/3's ruling) |
//! | `aggregations` | `aggregations` |
//! | `highlight` | `highlight` |
//! | `group_by` | `groupBy` |
//! | `track_total_hits` | `trackTotalHits` |
//!
//! Inside the retrievers, the filter IR and the answer:
//!
//! | REST | RPC |
//! |---|---|
//! | `vector` / `text` / `fused` / `rescore` / `sparse` (arm) | identical (a proto oneof is spelled like serde's external tagging) |
//! | `refine_factor` | `refineFactor` |
//! | `idf_corpus` | `idfCorpus` |
//! | `weighted_sum` (arm) | `weightedSum` |
//! | `match_all` / `match_none` (value, see below) | `{"matchAll": {}}` / `{"matchNone": {}}` |
//! | `match_phrase`, `multi_match`, `values_count`, `is_null`, `is_empty`, `query_string`, `constant_score` (arms) | `matchPhrase`, `multiMatch`, `valuesCount`, `isNull`, `isEmpty`, `queryString`, `constantScore` |
//! | `minimum_should_match` | `minimumShouldMatch` |
//! | `tie_breaker` | `tieBreaker` |
//! | `must_not` | `mustNot` |
//! | `default_fields` | `defaultFields` |
//! | `default_operator` | `defaultOperator` |
//! | `pre_tag` / `post_tag` | `preTag` / `postTag` |
//! | `fragment_size` / `number_of_fragments` | `fragmentSize` / `numberOfFragments` |
//! | `group_size` | `groupSize` |
//! | `up_to` | `upTo` |
//! | `ids: [1, {"uuid": "…"}]` (bare primary keys) | `ids: [{"uint": "1"}, {"uuid": "…"}]` (`DocumentId`, Task 3) |
//! | `read_token` (answer) | `readToken` |
//! | `hot_used` (answer) | `hotUsed` |
//! | `sort_values` | `sortValues` |
//! | `sparse_vectors` | `sparseVectors` |
//!
//! Three more rules, all deliberate:
//!
//! - **A `null` is an absent field.** proto3 JSON has no `null` for a scalar
//!   or a message field, and a field at its default is *absent*. The REST
//!   fixture spells its defaults out (`"nprobes": null`,
//!   `"minimum_should_match": null`, `"fusion": null`), so [`camel`] **drops**
//!   a null key rather than sending it: on the RPC the same value is the field
//!   being absent.
//! - **A oneof arm is `{"arm": {…}}` on both surfaces.** `WriteOp` set this
//!   precedent in this package ("a proto oneof, so the JSON is the REST
//!   route's `{"upsert": {…}}` unchanged"), and `Query`, `Retriever`,
//!   `Fusion` and `SortKey` follow it: the arm names do not change, and a unit
//!   arm's value becomes an empty object because `"match_all"` has no oneof
//!   spelling.
//! - **A hit's `pk` is the `DocumentId` oneof**, the same message
//!   `Document.id` already uses, for Task 3's reason: `google.protobuf.Value`
//!   holds numbers in a `double`, so the fixture's `u64::MAX` id would come
//!   back as `18446744073709552000` — a different document.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — enums
//!
//! The IR's enums are serde `rename_all = "snake_case"`
//! (`ReadConsistency::AtLeast` → `"at_least"`, `SortOrder::Asc` → `"asc"`),
//! while proto3 JSON emits the **proto name** in `UPPER_SNAKE`. The values
//! this file sends and expects, with this package's `ENUM_NAME_VALUE` prefix
//! convention (the same one `OpResult` and `HotStateKind` already follow):
//!
//! | REST | RPC |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ReadConsistency::Strong` / `Eventual` | `consistency.freshness`: `FRESHNESS_STRONG` / `FRESHNESS_EVENTUAL` (Task 3's `Freshness`) |
//! | `ReadConsistency::AtLeast(token)` | `consistency.atLeast` (a string, Task 3) |
//! | `BoolOperator::Or` / `And` | `BOOL_OPERATOR_OR` / `BOOL_OPERATOR_AND` |
//! | `MultiMatchKind::BestFields`, … | `MULTI_MATCH_KIND_BEST_FIELDS`, … |
//! | `SortOrder::Asc` / `Desc` | `SORT_ORDER_ASC` / `SORT_ORDER_DESC` |
//! | `MissingOrder::First` / `Last` | `MISSING_ORDER_FIRST` / `MISSING_ORDER_LAST` |
//! | `TotalRelation::Eq` / `Gte` | `TOTAL_RELATION_EQ` / `TOTAL_RELATION_GTE` |
//!
//! An enum **read** is asserted by *value* through [`enum_is`], which accepts
//! any spelling that ends in the value's name, so the numbering and the prefix
//! stay the implementer's choice. An enum **sent** cannot be: this file sends
//! exactly one (`operator: BOOL_OPERATOR_OR`, in
//! `filter_ir_is_accepted_in_every_form_the_rest_route_takes`) and that one
//! name is pinned. Everything else this file sends takes its default, which is
//! why no fixture has to name an enum to be meaningful.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — the §05 §4 body, and what "accepted as the JSON mapping" means
//!
//! Design §05 §4's example body is a **different spelling of the same
//! request**, not a different request, and this file pins how each of its
//! shorthands lands on the message:
//!
//! | §05 §4 | RPC |
//! |---|
//! | `"from": "collections.kb"` | the same key, the same value: `SearchRequest.from`, the alias of `collection`, `"collections.kb"` and `"kb"` both accepted |
//! | `"retrieve": [...]` | the same key: `SearchRequest.retrieve`, the alias of `retrievers`, same element shape |
//! | `"fuse": {"method": "rrf", "k": 60}` | the same key, **verbatim**: `SearchRequest.fuse` is a `google.protobuf.Struct`, so `method` stays the §05 §4 string and needs no `FUSION_METHOD_*` name |
//! | `"consistency": "strong"` | `"consistency": {"freshness": "FRESHNESS_STRONG"}` — `consistency` is the `Consistency` message of this package (Task 3), and a message field has no bare-string form |
//! | `"select": ["id", "_score", "body"]` | `"select": {"source": {"include": ["body"]}}` — `select` is the projection `Struct` of Task 2/3; `id` and `_score` are always answered, so they are not in it |
//! | `"text": {"field": "body", "query": "refund", "k": 10}` | `{"text": {"query": {"match": {"field": "body", "text": "refund"}}, "k": 10}}` — §05 §4's `field` + string `query` *is* the IR's `Query::Match` |
//!
//! Everything else of the §05 §4 body is the IR's own spelling, lowerCamel.
//! The two M3 stages stay refused on both surfaces: a body carrying `expand`
//! or `rerank` is `invalid_argument` and says so, rather than being ignored
//! the way proto3 JSON ignores an unknown field — which is precisely why the
//! hybrid aliases are read *before* the typed decode.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — `page_token` on the shipped `ScrollDocuments`
//!
//! Plan ruling 2 says `ScrollDocuments` "is server-streaming of pages with a
//! cursor field (provisional default for Q614; **Task 4 may switch to unary
//! pagination if Q614 is answered so) … unary pagination also offered via
//! `page_token`". Q614 is unanswered and the **unary** RPC already shipped in
//! Task 3 with 18 green tests behind it, so this file pins the *additive*
//! reading rather than breaking a shipped contract:
//!
//! - `loams.collection.v1.DocumentService/ScrollDocuments` **stays unary**.
//! - It **gains `page_token`**, the AIP-158 spelling of the same cursor
//!   pagination `after` already is. `page_token` is a `DocumentId`, the same
//!   type as `after`, so there is exactly **one** cursor encoding on the wire
//!   and the two are interchangeable: `scroll_streams_pages_with_cursor`
//!   drives a whole pagination through `page_token`, drives the same
//!   pagination through `after`, and asserts the pages are identical.
//! - `ScrollDocumentsResponse.next` is unchanged: the shipped field.
//! - If both are set they must name the same cursor; a request that sets them
//!   to different cursors is `invalid_argument`. (Not asserted here: it is the
//!   one behaviour with no REST precedent to compare against.)
//!
//! **If the owner wants true server-streaming, that is a *separate additive*
//! RPC** (a `StreamScrollDocuments`, or the same service with a streaming
//! method) and not a change to this one. Q614 stays the question that decides
//! it.
//!
//! ## **WIRE** — `filter` on the document RPCs stays a `Value`
//!
//! Task 4 types the filter IR, but `ScrollDocuments.filter`,
//! `CountDocuments.filter`, `DeleteByFilter.filter` and
//! `PatchByFilter.filter` are already shipped as `google.protobuf.Value` and
//! Task 3's 18 green tests send the **bare string** `"match_all"`, which a
//! typed oneof cannot spell. This file therefore drives every document RPC's
//! filter in the REST flat form (`{"term": {"field": "tenant", "value": "b"}}`),
//! which is valid as a `Value` *and* as a typed `Query::Term` — so this file
//! passes whichever way the implementer reads that field, and Task 3's tests
//! keep passing. The typed `Query` lands on `SearchRequest.filter`.
//!
//! ## `performance`
//!
//! Design §05 §4 and the plan name a `performance` block on every native
//! search answer. Neither surface has one today: `SearchResponse` in
//! `crates/loams-query/src/ir.rs` has no such field and nothing in the query
//! crate computes it. So `SearchResponse`'s documented keys **allow**
//! `performance` (Task 4 is the task that names it) but no test asserts it,
//! and `routing_and_ranking_match_rest_for_every_fixture` compares *ranking*
//! — ids, order, scores, sources, totals — rather than whole bodies, so a
//! `performance` block added to one surface only cannot break the equality.
//! Adding it to one surface and not the other is what this test exists to
//! prevent; adding it to both is a separate task.
//!
//! ## The hot layer reaches the Connect path, or this file cannot pass
//!
//! `api::router` registers the Connect routes with `.merge(connect)` **after**
//! `.layer(hot_layer)`, so today a Connect answer carries no
//! `loams-hot-used` header and `Loams-Hot` is never parsed on an RPC path.
//! Ruling 11 puts every route inside the hot layer and §05 §4 makes the hot
//! tier a query stage, so a `Search` that could not use a hot structure would
//! be a different query engine from the REST one. Merging the Connect router
//! inside the layer (or layering it) is part of this task.
