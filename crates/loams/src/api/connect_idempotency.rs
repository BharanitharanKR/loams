//! The answers of recently-keyed `WriteDocuments` calls (design §44 §7.3,
//! D610; API1 Task 3).
//!
//! `WriteDocuments` is the first RPC of the API that is not idempotent by
//! construction (plan ruling 2.4): a client that retries after a lost answer
//! would otherwise write the same documents twice. `idempotency_key` says "this
//! is a retry", and this module is what makes that true — the same key under
//! the same request **replays** the first answer (the same token, the same
//! per-op results and the same positions) instead of writing again.
//!
//! ## What it is, precisely
//!
//! - **Per process.** The ledger is this node's memory. A retry that lands on
//!   another node of a cluster is a fresh write there. That is the same gap
//!   every REST write has, and closing it needs a shared store rather than a
//!   local map, so it is stated here rather than assumed away.
//! - **The immediate retry, and nothing longer.** An answer is kept for
//!   [`WINDOW`] and while the ledger holds fewer than [`ENTRIES`] others; past
//!   either bound a repeat is a fresh write. A stale answer is worse than a
//!   late one: a client that is told "created" for a write that did not happen,
//!   or that is handed a token for another request's write, has a wrong answer
//!   with no way to notice.
//! - **Only a repeat of the same request.** An entry is keyed by
//!   (namespace, collection, key) and carries the fingerprint the caller
//!   computed, so one key under two *different* requests does not answer one
//!   with the other's token — it is a second write, which is what a client
//!   reusing a key wrongly has done.
//!
//! ## Two parts, and why
//!
//! [`Ledger::gate`] is a per-key lock and [`Ledger::replay`] /
//! [`Ledger::remember`] are the answers. The lock is what makes the guarantee
//! hold for a retry that arrives *while* the first call is still running, which
//! is the case that matters: without it, two concurrent requests under one key
//! both miss the ledger and both write. It is one `Mutex` per key rather than
//! one for the whole ledger, so unrelated keyed writes do not queue behind each
//! other — and a key nobody is holding any more drops its entry, so the map is
//! bounded by the calls in flight rather than by the keys ever seen.
