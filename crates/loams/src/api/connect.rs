//! The Connect API on the main port (design §44 §4, D600; API1 Task 1).
//!
//! One port serves the Connect protocol, gRPC and gRPC-Web at once:
//! connect-rust answers all three from one handler, so a `curl` POST of JSON,
//! a `grpcurl` call and a browser's gRPC-Web fetch are the same RPC. This
//! module owns that wiring and nothing else:
//!
//! - the **catalogue** (`CATALOGUE`): every public `loams.*.v1` package that
//!   exists, its services, and whether this binary serves them;
//! - [`InstanceService`], which an SDK calls first, before sign-in, to
//!   feature-detect from `GetInstance.services[]`;
//! - the stub an **unavailable** package answers with: `unimplemented` with
//!   the reason `feature_not_in_variant` and the variant in `metadata`;
//! - `grpc.health.v1`, and `grpc.reflection.v1` where reflection is on.
//!
//! The native REST routes in [`super`] are **not** replaced here. Tasks 2–8
//! add one RPC per route and Task 9 deletes the route, so [`super::router`]
//! serves both for now. The Connect paths are registered as their own axum
//! routes rather than as the router's fallback, precisely so that the native
//! `no_route` fallback stays the answer for a path neither API knows
//! (`it/http.rs::framework_rejections_use_the_json_error_body`).

// The generated service traits return `impl Encodable<_>`; these impls name
// the concrete message type, which is the intended refinement.
