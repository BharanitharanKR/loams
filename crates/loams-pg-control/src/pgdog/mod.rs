//! PgDog, as `pg-control` talks to it (design §46 §8): through its admin
//! database, one Deployment per Loams namespace. So far only the seam
//! ([`PgDogAdmin`], the shared contract's RT1 adapter, extended) and the
//! implementation for a deployment with no PgDog in front of its endpoints
//! ([`NoPgDog`]). The idle monitor (Task 12) reads the clients of an
//! endpoint's pools through it; rendering, the config push and the admin
//! adapter itself are PG2c's (Tasks 20–22), the waker's polling Task 26's.
