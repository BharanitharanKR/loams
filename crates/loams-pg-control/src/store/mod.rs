//! `PgControlStore`: where `pg-control` keeps its records (design §46 §6.2,
//! D705; PG2 Task 3).
//!
//! One implementation, [`KvControlStore`], serves both backends through
//! `loams-kv`'s store seam (ruling R3.1): [`local`] opens the embedded
//! store (MVCC on redb) for single-node mode, and [`tikv`] (feature `tikv`)
//! a `loams-tikv` handle on the metastore's keyspace and root for
//! production. [`conformance`] holds both to the same semantics
//! ([`pg_control_store_conformance!`](crate::pg_control_store_conformance)).
//!
//! **Versions.** Every record carries a version, a `u64` the store assigns
//! on each write: the writing transaction's start timestamp, which under
//! snapshot isolation grows with every committed write of a key, across a
//! delete and a re-create too. Writes are compare-and-set on it: `put` with
//! `expected: None` creates, with `Some(v)` replaces version `v`; `delete`
//! needs the current version.
//!
//! **Fences.** Every write of [`PgControlStore`] carries a [`Fence`] from
//! [`acquire_lease`](PgControlStore::acquire_lease). The write checks,
//! in its own transaction, that the lease is still at the fence's epoch and
//! held, and locks the lease record, so a takeover committed meanwhile
//! conflicts with it: `loams-meta-tikv`'s `check_fence` (R3.2). A stale
//! fence's write fails with [`StoreError::Fenced`]. Unfenced writes (the API
//! service's, which hold no project lease) exist only on [`ApiWriter`], from
//! [`KvControlStore::api_writer`], not on the trait that reconcilers take
//! (R3.10).
//!
//! **Unknown outcomes.** Writes carry a commit token, so a lost
//! acknowledgement is resolved; when it cannot be, the write fails with
//! [`StoreError::Undetermined`] and may have applied.
