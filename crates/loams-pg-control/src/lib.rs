//! Loams Postgres's control plane, `pg-control` (design §46 §6; PG2).
//!
//! So far: the records ([`model`]) and the store they live in
//! ([`store::PgControlStore`]), on the embedded store in single-node mode
//! and on TiKV in production (Task 3); resource ids and the derived Neon
//! ids ([`ids`]), and names and PgDog's routed-name grammar ([`names`])
//! (Task 4); the project and branch RPCs ([`service`]) with their
//! operations and idempotency ledger, and the seam to Neon's components
//! they read through ([`neon::NeonRead`]) (Task 5); the role and database
//! RPCs and the [`secrets::SecretStore`] role passwords live in (Task 6);
//! the project and branch reconcilers, under each project's fenced lease
//! ([`reconcile`]) (Task 7); the upcall listener Neon's components call,
//! with the compute tokens it checks ([`upcall`]) (Task 8); who may call
//! ([`authz`]) and the audit events every mutation emits ([`audit`])
//! (Task 9). Reached only through `loams`'s feature `postgres` (Task 9),
//! whose `pg-control` role serves this crate.
