//! loams-agentd: Loams Desktop's per-user agent daemon (design §50).
//!
//! The library holds the process model the binary runs: the daemon directory,
//! `config.toml`, the single-instance lock, the token, discovery and `Hello`
//! (plan DD1 Task 6), the RPC's access control (Task 7), and the per-user
//! service, the runtime directory and linger (Task 8), and the remote
//! Connect listener's settings (plan SD1 Task 7).
