//! What Loams's embedded graph engine actually does, measured against Grafeo 0.5.43.
//!
//! Every test here drives the crate the way the Connect-RPC service does — `service::create_graph`,
//! `service::execute`, and the rest — so the protobuf conversions are exercised by the same
//! assertions that exercise the engine. Where a claim in the design is only true up to what an
//! engine does, the test says which part it measured; see `tests/probe*` history in the report for
//! the readings these assertions are drawn from.
