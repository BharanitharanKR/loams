//! Capturing a committed transaction's change set from the engine (design §48 §6.3, Q672).
//!
//! GR1 Task 9 measured mechanism B, Grafeo's CDC, and rules it the mechanism (R9.1). The CDC
//! events alone are not a usable record (R0.6): a label event does not say whether a label was
//! added or removed, an edge delete carries no type or endpoints, and the events of one commit come
//! back in hash order. So [`CdcCapture`] uses the events only for *which* elements the commit
//! touched, and reads what each one now is from the store (R9.2).
//!
//! That read is the state at the commit's epoch only because nothing else writes the engine
//! between the commit and the capture: the caller holds the graph's write lane across both (R0.5),
//! and GR1 Task 11 holds the lane's exclusive gate from `begin_transaction` until the change set is
//! durable (R9.3).
