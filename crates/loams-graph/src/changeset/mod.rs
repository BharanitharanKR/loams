//! What a committed write transaction changed, in Loams' own terms (design §48 §6.3, §6.4).
//!
//! A [`ChangeOp`] list is the body of a `GraphChangeSet`: the log record that makes a write
//! durable (D742). It names elements by Loams element ids and carries whole values, so a reader of
//! the log needs no Grafeo to understand it (I6). The record envelope and its codec are GR1 Task 10;
//! this module holds the operations, how they are captured from the engine ([`capture`]), and how
//! they are applied to a fresh engine ([`apply_to_store`]), which is what replay, recovery and
//! followers do (Tasks 14 and 15).
//!
//! The operations describe a transaction's **net effect**, not its sequence of mutations. Capture
//! resolves every element the transaction touched against the store as the transaction left it
//! (R9.2), so an element created and deleted inside one transaction produces nothing, and a node
//! whose labels changed is written whole. The order inside one change set is canonical: node
//! upserts, then edge upserts, then property changes, then edge deletes, then node deletes, which
//! is an order that can always be applied (an edge's endpoints exist before it, and a node's edges
//! are gone before it).
