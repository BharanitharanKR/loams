//! The embedded engine wrapper: opening graphs and running statements against Grafeo.
//!
//! This is the whole of Loams's in-process graph surface. Everything the Connect-RPC service needs
//! is here, so the service layer above is transport and nothing else, and the engine can be tested
//! without a server.
//!
//! Three things in this module are worth reading before changing anything:
//!
//! * **A statement reaches Grafeo unchanged.** Nothing here parses, rewrites or re-indents a
//!   statement; [`Graph::execute`] hands the caller's bytes to the engine and reports what came
//!   back. The one thing that *reads* a statement is [`writes`], the read-only guard, and it reads
//!   without modifying.
//! * **What the engine does not measure is reported as absent, not as zero.** Grafeo 0.5.43's
//!   `QueryResult` carries `execution_time_ms` and `rows_scanned` and nothing else; see
//!   [`GraphResult`] for exactly which of the contract's counters have an engine behind them.
//! * **The read-only guard is deliberately lopsided.** A read refused as a write costs a caller one
//!   retry; a write let through as a read costs correctness. So the guard knows the keywords that
//!   cannot write and treats everything else as a write.
