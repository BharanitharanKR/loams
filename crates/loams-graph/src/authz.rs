//! Per-graph authorization (GR1 Task 24, design §48 §11, D750).
//!
//! The object is `graph:<ns>/<name>`, and a caller holds one of three relations on it, least to
//! most: `reader`, `writer`, `admin` (§48 §11.1's OpenFGA type, `docs/authz/graph.fga`). Each RPC
//! needs one ([`Need`]):
//!
//! | RPC | Needs |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Execute`, `ExecuteStream`, `Explain` | the statement's [`Access`]: `reader` for a read, `writer` for a write, `admin` for DDL |
//! | `ExecuteBatch` | the strongest of its statements' |
//! | `GetGraph`, `GetSchema` | `reader` |
//! | `ListGraphs` | nothing on the namespace; each graph is answered only to a `reader` of it ([`filter_visible`]) |
//! | `CreateGraph` | `admin` on the namespace (which creates the namespace when it does not exist) |
//! | `UpdateGraph`, `DeleteGraph` (and `Restore`/`Export`/`Import`, Task 29) | `admin`; in a protected environment also the project `admin` role ([`Need::Destroy`]) |
//!
//! A decision has three inputs, applied in this order ([`decide`]):
//!
//! 1. **The environment fence.** A credential bound to an environment reaches only that
//!    environment's namespace (an environment is one namespace, §19 §4); any other is refused,
//!    whatever its roles. The same rule as Live's app fence (LV1 T15-1).
//! 2. **The relation** a [`GraphAuthorizer`] answers ([`Standing`]): the caller's strongest
//!    relation on the graph, whether the namespace is a protected environment, and whether the
//!    caller holds the project `admin` role there. The server's authorizer expands the org and
//!    project roles of its principal store (the built-in RBAC, until MT1's OpenFGA); [`StaticRbac`]
//!    is a fixed table for tests and embedders.
//! 3. **The credential's scopes** (§48 §11.2 item 3): `graph:read`, `graph:write`, `graph:admin`
//!    cap the relation; a credential that names no scopes is not capped, and one that names
//!    scopes but none of these reaches no graph.
//!
//! A refusal is `PERMISSION_DENIED`, reason `permission_denied`, with `need` (the relation it
//! needed) in the `ErrorInfo`'s metadata, and is audited: one `audit = true` line and a count
//! ([`denials`]). The authorization is checked before the graph is looked up, so a caller who may
//! not read a graph cannot tell whether it exists.
//!
//! **Loams' own reads for a principal** (GR1 R24.12, amending R24.4): a search's `expand` and the
//! SQL graph and algorithm table functions are a principal's requests too. `loams-query` passes
//! each one's [`GraphCaller`](loams_query::graph::GraphCaller), and a principal's
//! ([`PrincipalReads`]) needs `reader` on every graph it touches, decided and audited here as an
//! RPC's is; a refusal fails the request (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `need` = `reader`). Only Loams'
//! own calls on no principal's behalf (links, a write-back, a forwarded call, maintenance) are
//! `GraphCaller::Internal` and unchecked.
//!
//! The engine session that runs a statement has the Grafeo role of the statement's own access,
//! which is never above the caller's relation (a statement needing more is refused here first),
//! so the engine still refuses a write that both classifiers called a read (§48 §11.2 item 1).
