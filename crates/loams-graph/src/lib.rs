//! Loams's embedded graph engine (design §33 D634).
//!
//! The engine is **Grafeo**, a graph database written in Rust, linked into this process and called
//! directly. The surface is **GQL**, the ISO standard (ISO/IEC 39075), served over **Connect-RPC** —
//! the protocol every other Loams service already speaks.
//!
//! Three consequences of D634 are visible in this module rather than merely documented:
//!
//! * **No Bolt.** Bolt's Rust ecosystem has been frozen since December 2022 and the one maintained
//!   client, `neo4rs`, is Neo4j-specific rather than portable. Reaching an engine Loams embeds over
//!   Bolt would add a second RPC stack to avoid the one Loams already has.
//! * **No network, so no credential.** [`Graph::open`] takes a path, not a URL. A remote engine
//!   would need a secret; an embedded one has none, which is why the Grafeo manifest's `auth` is
//!   `none` and its `secrets` list is empty.
//! * **No query rewriting.** A statement is passed to the engine unchanged. Classification and
//!   projection belong to the connector layer (design §33 §4); a graph statement Loams edited
//!   would no longer be the statement the user wrote.
//!
//! What this crate is *not*: it is not a connector. It is the engine behind one, and the connector
//! that exposes it to a route is CN1's `loams_flow::connectors::graph`, whose manifest is
//! `connectors/registry/grafeo.yaml`.
