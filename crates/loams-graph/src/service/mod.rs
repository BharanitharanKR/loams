//! The Connect-RPC surface over an embedded [`Engine`]: `loams.graph.v1`'s `GraphService`
//! ([`data`]) and the part of `GraphAdminService` an in-process registry can answer.
//!
//! This layer is transport. What a statement may do is decided in [`crate::classify`] and enforced
//! again by the engine's roles ([`crate::engine`]); values cross through [`crate::value`].
//!
//! **Transitional.** What is not here yet, and the task that adds it:
//!
//! * the catalog (versions, AIP-158 pages, `GetSchema`, deleting through an operation that purges
//!   storage): Task 4. Until then `ListGraphs` answers every graph in one page and `DeleteGraph`
//!   closes the graph and answers a finished operation with no id;
//! * consistency tokens, commit epochs, counters and idempotency: Tasks 11 and 15;
//! * LINKED graphs: Task 17. Restore, export and import: Task 29.
//!
//! A graph is created under the engine's data directory, `<data_dir>/graphs/<graph_id>/`, or in
//! memory when the engine has none (Task 3). No request names a path (Review Focus 4).
//!
//! The functions are free rather than methods on [`GraphServiceImpl`] because they are what the
//! generated server traits will call one for one (Task 5), and a test can call them without a
//! router.
